## Curriculum Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Game-First Development**
- Every lesson improves an actual, playable game
- No abstract exercises or theoretical concepts in isolation
- Milestones: Playable → Complete → Polished → Professional

**2. Spiral Learning**
- Games revisited multiple times across phases at increasing complexity
- Students directly compare basic vs advanced VDP techniques
- Clear progression shows growth and mastery

**3. Pattern Library**
- Core techniques taught once, documented, then reused
- "Z80 addressing modes are Z80 addressing modes" - same concept, increasingly optimized
- Avoid teaching from scratch every time

**4. Genre Techniques, Not Recreations**
- Teach techniques applicable to game genres
- Not recreating specific classic games (though students learn their techniques)
- Students learn transferable skills

**5. Progressive Hardware Mastery**
- Phase 1-2: Master Master System base (Z80, VDP, PSG)
- Phase 3: **Advanced VDP mastery** - all techniques, scrolling, sprites
- Phase 4-6: Advanced techniques, pushing Master System limits
- Phase 7: **Maximum Master System** - all capabilities, professional development
- Phase 8: Modern Master System development (homebrew scene)
