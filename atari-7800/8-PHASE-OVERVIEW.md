## Curriculum Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Game-First Development**
- Every lesson improves an actual, playable game
- No abstract exercises or theoretical concepts in isolation
- Milestones: Playable → Complete → Polished → Professional

**2. Spiral Learning**
- Games revisited multiple times across phases at increasing complexity
- Students directly compare basic MARIA vs MARIA+POKEY implementations
- Clear progression shows growth and mastery

**3. Pattern Library**
- Core techniques taught once, documented, then reused
- "MARIA display lists are MARIA display lists" - same concept, increasingly optimized
- Avoid teaching from scratch every time

**4. Genre Techniques, Not Recreations**
- Teach techniques applicable to game genres
- Not recreating specific classic games (though students learn their techniques)
- Students learn transferable skills

**5. Progressive Hardware Mastery**
- Phase 1-2: Master 7800 base (6502C, MARIA, 4KB RAM, TIA audio)
- Phase 3: **MARIA+POKEY mastery** - advanced graphics, POKEY sound chip
- Phase 4-6: Advanced techniques, pushing 7800 limits
- Phase 7: **Maximum 7800** - all capabilities, 2600 compatibility mastery
- Phase 8: Modern 7800 development (homebrew scene)

- 3.77 million units sold (vs NES's 61M - commercial failure)
- **2600 backward compatible** (entire 2600 library playable!)
- **Better graphics than 2600** (MARIA vs TIA)
- **Same audio as 2600** (TIA audio - major limitation!)
- Competed with NES/Master System (lost badly)
- Short commercial lifespan (1986-1992)
