# New Intro Summary

## What Changed

Completely rewrote the personal introduction (slides 1-7) to be more vivid, cinematic, and emotionally resonant.

## New Opening Sequence (32 slides total, up from 30)

### Slide 1: The Scene
```
Once upon a time,
there was a living room.
A television set.
A Commodore 64 on the floor.
```
**Font**: 42pt (reduced from 72pt to fit)
**Impact**: Sets the scene with concrete details, not abstractions

### Slide 2: The People
```
A young boy.
An older man.
A thick book of code.
Typing.
```
**Font**: 42pt
**Impact**: Introduces the characters, builds tension with "Typing"

### Slide 3: The Magic Moment
```
Line by line,
a game took shape.
Hangman.
Character-based gallows.
A little man hanging.
```
**Font**: 34pt (5 lines, needs smaller font)
**Impact**: Shows the magic happening in real-time

### Slide 4: The Impact
```
To that boy,
it was magic.
```
**Font**: 72pt (just 2 lines, can breathe)
**Impact**: Simple, powerful emotional beat

### Slide 5: The Dream
```
That magic
sparked a dream.
A dream of
making games.
```
**Font**: 42pt
**Impact**: Establishes the core motivation

### Slide 6: The Journey
```
The boy grew up.
Became a software engineer.
But the dream?
Never faded.
```
**Font**: 42pt
**Impact**: Bridges childhood to present, "But the dream?" creates tension

### Slide 7: The Commitment
```
Now it's time
to make it real.
```
**Font**: 72pt (just 2 lines)
**Impact**: Powerful commitment statement before the logo reveal

### Slide 8: Logo Reveal
[Image only - Code Like It's 198x logo]
**Impact**: First visual appearance of project name, after full emotional setup

### Slides 9+: Rest of Presentation
Vision, scope, how it works, etc. (continues from before)

## Why This Is Better

### Old Intro (5 slides):
1. "I'm going to tell you a story..."
2. "About a kid who watched his dad code Hangman..."
3. "That sparked a dream to make games. Didn't quite happen. But close enough." ❌ Vague
4. "Lately, programming feels more mystical than ever..." ❌ Disconnected
5. "So I'm going back to when computers had <0.1% of today's RAM..."

**Problems**:
- Slide 3 was unclear ("Didn't quite happen. But close enough" - what does this mean?)
- Slide 4 jumped to philosophy without connection to personal story
- Missing emotional beats and concrete details

### New Intro (7 slides):
1. The Scene - Living room, TV, C64 on floor
2. The People - Boy, man, book, typing
3. The Magic Moment - Line by line, Hangman appears
4. The Impact - "it was magic"
5. The Dream - Sparked a dream of making games
6. The Journey - Boy grew up, became engineer, dream never faded
7. The Commitment - "Now it's time to make it real"

**Strengths**:
- ✅ **Cinematic**: You can visualize the scene (living room, trailing cables, C64 on floor)
- ✅ **Show, don't tell**: Character-based gallows appearing line by line vs "sparked a dream"
- ✅ **Emotional arc**: Magic → Dream → Journey → Commitment
- ✅ **Clear narrative**: No confusing "didn't quite happen" moments
- ✅ **Better pacing**: 7 slides allows breathing room for each beat
- ✅ **Concrete details**: "Thick book of code", "character-based gallows", "little man hanging"

## Technical Details

- Added 2 slides (30 → 32 total)
- Font sizes reduced significantly for intro (34pt-72pt range, mostly 42pt)
- All slides pass overflow validation
- Logo reveal timing unchanged (still slide 8 in final numbering)

## Font Sizes Applied

**Intro slides** (had to reduce due to template text box constraints):
- Slides 1, 2, 5, 6: 42pt (4 lines each)
- Slide 3: 34pt (5 lines - needs smallest)
- Slide 4, 7: 72pt (2 lines each - can be larger)

**Content slides** (carried over from previous version with some adjustments):
- Most remain at previous sizes
- A few required minor adjustments due to template differences

## Story Arc Comparison

**Before:**
- Announcement of story → Kid watching dad → Vague outcome → Philosophy → Solution

**After:**
- Scene setting → Characters → Magic happening → Emotional impact → Dream forms → Life journey → Commitment → [LOGO REVEAL]

The new version is a proper story with setup, conflict (dream vs reality), and resolution (making it real).
