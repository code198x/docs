# Vault Slide Addition Summary

## What Changed

Added a new slide (29) introducing **The Vault** - the project's comprehensive encyclopedia of retro gaming culture and technology.

## New Slide 29: The Vault

```
The Vault:
Encyclopedia of retro gaming.
Games. Creators. Machines.
Cultural context. Everything.
```

**Font**: 54pt (title), 38pt (body)
**Position**: After slide 28 ("100% free / 100% open source")
**Total slides**: 34 (up from 33)

## Why This Matters

The Vault is a unique differentiator that goes far beyond typical reference documentation:

### What The Vault Covers:

**Technical:**
- Games themselves
- Hardware (machines, CPUs, key components)
- Manufacturers

**Cultural/Historical:**
- Game creators and studios
- Publishers
- Historical events that influenced games
  - Miners' Strike games
  - Cold War influences
  - Social/political context of the era

**Comprehensive Encyclopedia:**
- Everything interconnected
- Not just "here are some specs"
- The complete story of retro gaming

## Why It's Positioned Here

**Slide flow:**
- Slide 27: [Image/transition]
- Slide 28: "100% free. 100% open source" (what it costs)
- **Slide 29: "The Vault" (what you get)** ← NEW
- Slide 30: "Like it? GitHub Sponsors" (how to support)
- Slide 31: Discord/GitHub Discussions (community)

The Vault naturally follows the "free/open source" message as another aspect of what's provided to learners.

## Unique Angle

Most retro programming courses provide:
- ✅ Code examples
- ✅ Hardware specs
- ✅ Maybe some documentation links

Code Like It's 198x provides:
- ✅ All of the above
- ✅ **Plus**: Complete cultural and historical encyclopedia
- ✅ Understanding WHY certain games were made
- ✅ The social/political context of the era
- ✅ Everything interconnected

This positions the project as not just teaching programming, but teaching the **complete context** of retro game development.

## Pattern Library

Not mentioned in the presentation yet. Could be added:
- As part of "what you get" section
- Alongside The Vault
- Or as separate slide about learning resources

Current status:
- BASIC routines: Active
- Assembly routines: Will expand as content is created

## Technical Details

- Expanded presentation from 33 to 34 slides
- Inserted new slide at position 29
- All subsequent slides shifted by +1
- Font sizes: 54pt title, 38pt body (reduced to fit)
- All slides pass overflow validation

## Files

- `final-with-vault.pptx` (workspace)
- `/Users/stevehill/Desktop/Code Like It's 198x - Updated.pptx` ✅ LATEST
- `replacement-text-with-vault-final2.json` (final replacement text)

## Impact

The presentation now communicates:
- ✅ **Comprehensive scope** (71 systems, 30 years)
- ✅ **Game-first pedagogy** (build games from lesson 1)
- ✅ **Beyond commercial quality** (demoscene + modern techniques)
- ✅ **Modern hardware** (MEGA65, ZX Spectrum Next, etc.)
- ✅ **Free/open source** (MIT + Creative Commons)
- ✅ **The Vault** - unique cultural encyclopedia ← NEW
- ✅ **Community** (Discord, GitHub)
- ✅ **Get involved** (test, contribute, support)

The Vault adds a unique differentiator that no other retro programming course has - the complete cultural and historical context of the era.
