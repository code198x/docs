# Presentation Image Recommendations

## Executive Summary

Strategic placement of **5-6 images** across 34 slides will strengthen the presentation by providing visual proof of scope, capabilities, and substance. All recommended images are either:
- **Public domain** (Vanamo Online Game Museum)
- **Your own content** (lesson screenshots)
- **Official product photos** (modern hardware manufacturers)

**Layout Suggestion**:
- 5 systems arranged chronologically left-to-right
- Equal sizing to show "we treat all platforms equally"
- Creates visual timeline from 1977→2000

**Why These Five**:
- Atari 2600: "Dawn" (1977)
- Commodore 64: Your origin story
- Game Boy: Represents handheld category
- Dreamcast: Last Sega console, innovative
- PS2: End of scope ("PS2 era")

### **Slide 18: Beyond Commercial Quality** ✅ HIGH PRIORITY

**Current Text**: "Beyond 1980s games. Demoscene tricks. Modern techniques discovered since."

**Purpose**: Show what "beyond commercial quality" actually means

**Challenge**: Need split-screen comparison showing 1985 commercial game vs 2024 demoscene effect

**Recommended Approach**:

**Option A: CSDb Comparison** (Requires manual work)
1. Visit https://csdb.dk/ (Commodore 64 Scene Database)
2. Find highly-rated 2024 demo with impressive visuals
3. Compare with commercial C64 game screenshot from 1985
4. Create split-screen image showing both

**Option B: Raster Bar Comparison** (Simpler)
1. **Left side**: Commercial game with simple graphics (e.g., Pac-Man, early platformer)
2. **Right side**: Modern raster bar/copper effect demonstration
3. Caption: "1985 Commercial → 2024 Demoscene"

**Option C: Use Your Own Lesson Content** (Easiest)
- Show progression from your own curriculum:
  - Left: Lesson 16 (BASIC limitations)
  - Right: Advanced assembly technique example
- Demonstrates the teaching progression itself

**Resource Links**:
- CSDb: https://csdb.dk/ (modern demos)
- Wikimedia for commercial games: Search "Commodore 64 game screenshot"

**Status**: Requires creating composite image (not found pre-made)

---

### **Slide 19: Modern Hardware** ✅ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current Text**: "MEGA65. ZX Spectrum Next. Amiga Vampire. ...and many more."

**Purpose**: Show these modern retro systems are real, gorgeous hardware

**Sources**:

#### **MEGA65**
- Official site: https://mega65.org/
- Available images at: https://files.mega65.org/
- Look for: Product photos from `assets/images/portfolio/`
- License: Check official site (likely permissive for educational use)

#### **ZX Spectrum Next**
- Official site: https://www.specnext.com/
- Product photos available on shop page
- License: Likely requires permission for commercial use

#### **Amiga Vampire V4**
- Official site: http://www.apollo-computer.com/v4standalone.php
- Shop page: http://shoq.apollo-computer.com/
- Black anodized aluminum case with red logo
- License: Likely requires permission

**Layout Suggestion**:
- 3 system photos, equal prominence
- Clean product shots against neutral backgrounds
- Shows sleek modern industrial design

**Alternative**: Use Wikimedia Commons if manufacturers deny permission
- Search for community-contributed photos
- May have lower quality but guaranteed licensing

---

### **Slide 27: Proof of Substance** ✅ MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Purpose**: Show the curriculum exists (not vaporware)

**Source**: Your own lesson content
- Path: `/Users/stevehill/Projects/Code198x/website/public/images/commodore-64/phase-0/tier-1/`

**Available Screenshots**:
- `lesson-007/example-1.png` - POKE demonstration
- `lesson-007/example-2.png` - Color/sound example
- `lesson-008/example-1.png` - Advanced techniques
- `lesson-008/example-2.png` - Hardware interaction

**Recommended**:
- Use `lesson-008/example-2.png` (most visually interesting)
- Shows actual C64 screen with running code
- Proves "this is real, working content"

**Layout**:
- Single centered screenshot
- Could add caption: "One of 8,256 lessons"

---

### **Slide 3: Hangman Origin Story** ⚠️ OPTIONAL

**Current Text**: "Line by line, a game took shape. Hangman. Character-based gallows."

**Purpose**: Make origin story more tangible

**Challenge**:
- Need C64 Hangman screenshot (character-based graphics)
- Alternatively: Photo of BASIC code listing from book

**Sources**:

**Option A: CSDb Hangman Game**
- URL: https://csdb.dk/release/?id=160903 (Hangman V2 Basic for Kids)
- May have screenshots in database
- Check licensing (likely requires permission)

**Option B: Type-In Book Pages**
- Historical COMPUTE! magazine pages showing BASIC listing
- Would need to source from archive
- More evocative of "dad typing from thick book"

**Option C: Create Your Own**
- Write simple Hangman in 20 lines of BASIC
- Capture screenshot with x64sc
- Most authentic to your story

**Recommendation**: **Skip this one initially**
- Origin story works well with just text
- Risk of image feeling too specific/personal
- Could add later if presentation feels too text-heavy

---

## Implementation Priority

### **Phase 1: Essential Images** (Do First)
1. ✅ **Slide 9**: 5-system montage (PUBLIC DOMAIN - Easy)
2. ✅ **Slide 27**: Your lesson screenshot (OWN CONTENT - Trivial)

**Why**: Both are 100% safe to use, strengthen key messages

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Visuals** (Do Second)
3. ⚠️ **Slide 19**: Modern hardware photos (Requires permission)
4. ⚠️ **Slide 18**: Demoscene comparison (Requires creation)

**Why**: Strengthen credibility but require more work

### **Phase 3: Polish** (Optional)
5. ❌ **Slide 3**: Hangman screenshot (Skip initially)

**Why**: Nice to have, not essential to core message

## Next Steps

1. **Download Vanamo images** from Wikimedia Commons:
   - Commodore 64
   - Atari 2600
   - Game Boy
   - Dreamcast
   - PlayStation 2

2. **Copy your lesson screenshot**:
   - Use `/Users/stevehill/Projects/Code198x/website/public/images/commodore-64/phase-0/tier-1/lesson-008/example-2.png`

3. **Request permissions** (if desired):
   - Email MEGA65, ZX Spectrum Next, Apollo Computer
   - Explain educational/promotional use
   - Offer attribution

4. **Create composite images**:
   - Slide 9: Arrange 5 systems in Photoshop/GIMP
   - Slide 18: Create comparison (if proceeding)

5. **Insert into presentation**:
   - Use PowerPoint/Keynote image insertion
   - Center and size appropriately
   - Maintain original design aesthetic

## Design Considerations

### **What to Avoid**
- ❌ Generic stock photos (feels inauthentic)
- ❌ Too many images (becomes slideshow)
- ❌ Low-resolution images (looks unprofessional)
- ❌ Busy backgrounds (conflicts with minimal design)
- ❌ Text overlays (you have text boxes already)

### **What Works**
- ✅ Clean product photography
- ✅ Actual hardware/software screenshots
- ✅ Consistent visual style
- ✅ Strategic placement (reinforce key claims)
- ✅ Generous white space maintained

---

## Alternative: Minimal Approach

If adding images feels like "overkill," consider **just 2-3 images**:

1. **Slide 9**: System montage (proves scope)
2. **Slide 27**: Lesson screenshot (proves substance)
3. *Optional*: **Slide 19**: Modern hardware (proves ecosystem)

This keeps the presentation primarily text-focused while adding visual proof for the most ambitious claims.

---

## Final Recommendation

**Add 5-6 strategic images** as outlined above. Your presentation is text-only across 34 slides, which is unusual for a gaming/education presentation. The suggested images:

- Strengthen credibility (scope, modern hardware)
- Provide visual proof (not just aspirational)
- Break up text-heavy sections
- Maintain your clean, minimal design aesthetic

The Vanamo Online Game Museum images are **public domain**, so there's zero risk in using them. Start there, see how it feels, then decide whether to pursue permissions for modern hardware photos.

## Questions to Consider

Before proceeding, ask yourself:

1. **Audience**: Are these software engineers (appreciate technical detail) or broader audience (need visual hooks)?
2. **Context**: Conference talk (needs visuals) or pitch deck (text might suffice)?
3. **Tone**: Educational gravitas (minimal images) or enthusiastic showcase (more visuals)?

Your current text-only approach leans academic/serious. Adding 5-6 images would make it more engaging without becoming a nostalgia slideshow.
