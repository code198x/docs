## Technical Details

### **Enhanced Slide 18 Text**

The new text provides **concrete technical specifics**:

- **"Multicolor FLI"** - Flexible Line Interpretation, a hardware trick for more colors
- **"Raster effects"** - Real-time manipulation of display while screen draws
- **"Real-time 3D"** - Vector graphics on 1MHz CPU
- **"Dithered images"** - High-quality images within color limits
- **"Decades later"** - Most techniques discovered 2000s-2020s, not 1980s

This transforms "trust me, it's impressive" into "here are specific innovations."

### **Font & Color Preservation**

All changes maintain:
- **SN Pro Heavy** typeface
- **#5D5B7A** (purple-gray) for main text
- **#01A9F5** (bright blue) for accent text
- **32pt** font size (consistent with slide's existing text)
- **Center alignment** and **bold** formatting

## If You Need Adjustments

### **Slide 18 Text Too Technical?**
If "Multicolor FLI" feels too jargon-heavy, alternatives:

**Option A: More Accessible**
```
Beyond 1980s games.
Multiple color modes. Raster tricks.
Real-time 3D graphics. Photo-quality images.
Techniques discovered decades later.
```

**Option B: More Dramatic**
```
Beyond 1980s games.
Hardware hacks. Impossible effects.
Pushing 1982 silicon to 2024 limits.
Techniques that didn't exist yet.
```

**Option C: Current (Recommended)**
```
Beyond 1980s games.
Multicolor FLI. Raster effects.
Real-time 3D. Dithered images.
Techniques discovered decades later.
```

### **Want to Add More Images Later?**
If feedback suggests more visuals would help:
- **Slide 19** (modern hardware): MEGA65, Spectrum Next photos
- **Slide 18** (demoscene): DIY screenshot comparison
- Both can be added using same insertion process

### **Font Sizes Feel Wrong?**
Open in PowerPoint/Keynote and adjust:
- Select text box
- Format → Font → Size
- Typical range: 28pt-48pt for this presentation

## Final Thought

This presentation now balances **emotional storytelling** (the origin) with **rational proof** (systems montage, screenshot, specific techniques).

Your audience will:
1. **Feel** the personal journey (Slides 1-8)
2. **See** the massive scope (Slide 10 montage)
3. **Understand** the quality claim (Slide 18 specifics)
4. **Believe** it's real (Slide 28 screenshot)
5. **Want** to get involved (Slides 32-34)

The presentation sells itself through proof, not persuasion.

**You're ready to present.** 🎯
