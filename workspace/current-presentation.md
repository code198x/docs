Hi.

<!-- Slide number: 2 -->
I’m going to tell
you a story…

<!-- Slide number: 3 -->
About a kid who once
watched his dad
code a version of
Hangman…

<!-- Slide number: 4 -->

![Magic pouring from a 1980s computer screen overwhelming people sat in front of it](Picture2.jpg)
It felt like magic.

<!-- Slide number: 5 -->
That feeling sparked
a desire to learn.

<!-- Slide number: 6 -->
That kid grew up
wanting to
make games.

<!-- Slide number: 7 -->
That never quite
happened.
But close enough.

<!-- Slide number: 8 -->
That kid was me.
Obviously.

<!-- Slide number: 9 -->
Lately, I’ve been feeling
that programming has
become more mystical
than ever.

<!-- Slide number: 10 -->
Can you truly say that
you understand
everything
your code does?

<!-- Slide number: 11 -->
Are you sure?
What about all
your dependencies?Do you understandthose too?

<!-- Slide number: 12 -->
It got me thinking
about simpler times.

<!-- Slide number: 13 -->

![Dinosaurs in a primeval jungle](Picture2.jpg)
Before GitHub.
Before CI/CD.
Before ChatGPT.

<!-- Slide number: 14 -->
When computers had
less than 0.1% of the
RAM that they
have today.

<!-- Slide number: 15 -->
When every byte counted.
When every clock cycle
mattered.

<!-- Slide number: 16 -->
I thought it might be fun
to go back to those times.

<!-- Slide number: 17 -->

![a car is driving through a parking lot with a store in the background (provided by Tenor)](Picture2.jpg)
But I don’t have a time
machine.

<!-- Slide number: 18 -->
So, I did the
next best thing…

<!-- Slide number: 19 -->

<!-- Slide number: 20 -->
So, what is it?

<!-- Slide number: 21 -->
It’s a long-term
side project.
Like, multiple years.

<!-- Slide number: 22 -->
I’m aiming to recreate
the experience of
programming on vintage
8-bit and 16-bit
computers and consoles.

<!-- Slide number: 23 -->
I’m starting with
8-bit computers,
like the ZX Spectrum,
the Commodore 64
and the BBC Micro.

<!-- Slide number: 24 -->
From there, I’ll move on
to consoles, and the
16-bit computers like the
Amiga and the Atari ST.

<!-- Slide number: 25 -->
Why am I
doing this?

<!-- Slide number: 26 -->
I want to rediscover
the wonder of
programming.

<!-- Slide number: 27 -->
I want to explore how
people created
incredible software
on limited hardware.

<!-- Slide number: 28 -->
I want to demystify
low-level development
using modern tools, like
Docker, cross-compilers
and emulators.

<!-- Slide number: 29 -->
I want to highlight
the craft of code
in a constrained world.

<!-- Slide number: 30 -->
I want to learn,
and I want to teach.

<!-- Slide number: 31 -->
Also, I’m a massive
nerd.

<!-- Slide number: 32 -->
How will
it work?

<!-- Slide number: 33 -->
Choose a system.

<!-- Slide number: 34 -->
Learn the fundamentals.

<!-- Slide number: 35 -->
Build real projects.

<!-- Slide number: 36 -->
What will
it cover?

<!-- Slide number: 37 -->
All the common
computers and
consoles from
the 1980s
and 1990s.

<!-- Slide number: 38 -->
Using both BASIC and
assembly language
where appropriate.

<!-- Slide number: 39 -->
Building multiple
projects across
each tier.

<!-- Slide number: 40 -->
Who is it for?

<!-- Slide number: 41 -->
Me. And maybe you.

<!-- Slide number: 42 -->
Curious developers who
want to see how far
we’ve come.

<!-- Slide number: 43 -->
Anyone who started
on 8–bit or 16-bit
machines.

<!-- Slide number: 44 -->
Newcomers who want
to build something real
with low-level code.

<!-- Slide number: 45 -->
Parents wanting to
introduce kids
to programming
with historical context.

<!-- Slide number: 46 -->
Why does this
matter today?

<!-- Slide number: 47 -->
It teaches discipline,
clarity and
problem-solving.

<!-- Slide number: 48 -->
It makes you think
like a systems engineer.

<!-- Slide number: 49 -->
It reminds us how much
is possible with so little.

<!-- Slide number: 50 -->
It provides real joy:
blinking pixels and
beeper tunes still
feel like magic.

<!-- Slide number: 51 -->
Want to help?

<!-- Slide number: 52 -->
The site is online now at
code198x.stevehill.xyz

<!-- Slide number: 53 -->
The site code and
supporting materials
are online at
github.com/code198x

<!-- Slide number: 54 -->
Feedback, contributions
and test pilots
all welcome.

<!-- Slide number: 55 -->
If you had a childhood
machine – especially if
you still have it - tell me!
I might cover it!

<!-- Slide number: 56 -->
If you have kids and they
want to learn to code,
this might be a cool place
to start.

<!-- Slide number: 57 -->
Thanks!
