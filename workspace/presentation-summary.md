# Presentation Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the "Code Like It's 198x" presentation from 57 slides to 31 slides, preserving the original design style while completely refreshing the content to reflect the current game-first curriculum approach.

## Key Changes

### Structure
- **Original**: 57 slides (personal narrative + vague project description)
- **Updated**: 31 slides (focused, comprehensive project overview)
- **Reduction**: 46% fewer slides while adding more substantive information

### Content Updates

#### Added Critical Information:
1. **Massive scope**: 71 vintage systems (not just "common" ones)
2. **C64 curriculum details**: 8,256 lessons across 17 phases (Phases 0-16)
3. **Game-first pedagogy**: Build games from lesson 1
4. **Different learning paths**:
   - Home computers: BASIC → Assembly progression
   - Consoles (NES, etc.): Assembly-only path
5. **Beyond commercial quality**: Demoscene tricks + modern techniques
6. **Modern hardware**: MEGA65, ZX Spectrum Next, Amiga Vampire
7. **Free/open source**: MIT licensed code, CC content
8. **Sustainability model**: GitHub Sponsors, Patreon
9. **Community**: Discord, GitHub Discussions
10. **Clear prerequisites**: None (beginners and kids welcome)
11. **Tangible outcomes**: Portfolio of 100+ games

### Design Preservation
- **Font**: SN Pro Heavy (preserved)
- **Colors**: #5D5B7A (purple-gray), #01A9F5 (bright blue), #FEFCF8 (cream)
- **Layout**: Centered text, minimal design (preserved)
- **Approach**: Template-based using original slides

### Technical Challenges Solved

#### Text Overflow Issues:
Initially 19 slides had overflow errors. Resolved through:
1. **Font size adjustments**: Reduced from 72pt to 28-66pt where needed
2. **Text condensing**: 6 slides required shortened text
3. **Final adjustments**: All slides now fit properly

#### Final Slide Content (Restored Where Possible):
- **Slide 8**: "Commodore 64: / 8,256 lessons, / 100+ complete games." (3 lines, 42pt) ✅ Restored "complete"
- **Slide 14**: "8,192 assembly lessons. / 100+ games. / Pong → Platformers → / RPGs → Shoot-em-ups." (4 lines, 42pt) ✅ Restored "assembly" and "Shoot-em-ups"
- **Slide 15**: "Beyond 1980s games. / Demoscene tricks. / Modern techniques. / State-of-the-art retro." (4 lines, 32pt) ✅ Optimal
- **Slide 25**: "Like it? / GitHub Sponsors. Patreon. / Keep it sustainable." (3 lines, 42pt) ✅ Already optimal
- **Slide 26**: "Discord for chat. / GitHub Discussions for Q&A. / Share your games. / Learn together." (4 lines, 42pt) ✅ Restored full wording
- **Slide 28**: "Test lessons. Report bugs. / Tell me your childhood machine. / Help build the next 70 systems." (3 lines, 30pt) ✅ Improved wording
