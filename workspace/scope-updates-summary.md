# Scope Updates Summary

## What Changed

Updated the post-logo vision slides (10-21) to accurately reflect the full scope of the project: 30 years of computing history from 1977 to the PS2 era, not just 1977-1995.

## Key Updates

### Slide 10: The Full Scope ✅
**Old:**
```
71 vintage systems.
8-bit to 16-bit.
Computers and consoles.
1977-1995.
Original + modern hardware.
```

**New:**
```
71 systems.
From the dawn of home computing
to the PS2 era.
8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit.
```
**Font**: 42pt (reduced from 48pt)
**Impact**:
- Removed limiting "1977-1995" timeframe
- Added 32-bit and 64-bit coverage
- More poetic "dawn of home computing to PS2 era"

### Slide 11: System Examples ✅ NEW SLIDE
```
From Atari 2600
to PlayStation 2.
From Game Boy
to Dreamcast.
```
**Font**: 42pt
**Impact**:
- Poetic bookends showing the breadth
- Covers home consoles AND handhelds
- Concrete examples audience can visualize

### Slide 20: Modern Hardware ✅
**Old:**
```
MEGA65.
ZX Spectrum Next.
Amiga Vampire.
```

**New:**
```
MEGA65.
ZX Spectrum Next.
Amiga Vampire.
Original + expanded hardware.
```
**Font**: 54pt
**Impact**: Added context about "Original + expanded hardware" to clarify these are modern variants

### Slide 21: Console Path ✅
**Old:**
```
NES, Master System, Genesis:
No BASIC.
Jump straight to assembly.
Same goals: Beyond commercial.
```

**New:**
```
Consoles: No BASIC.
NES. Genesis. PlayStation.
Assembly from day one.
C when it makes sense.
```
**Font**: 54pt
**Impact**:
- Cleaner opening ("Consoles: No BASIC")
- Updated examples (NES, Genesis, PlayStation spans generations)
- Acknowledges C language ("C when it makes sense")
- More accurate to actual teaching approach

## Full Scope Now Communicated

### Time Range
- **1977 to ~2006** (Atari 2600 to PS2/Dreamcast era)
- Not limited to 1995

### Bit Depths
- **8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit**
- Not just "8-bit to 16-bit"

### System Categories Covered
- **Home computers**: Atari 2600, C64, ZX Spectrum, Amiga, Atari ST
- **Consoles**: NES, SNES, Genesis, PlayStation, N64, PS2, Dreamcast
- **Handhelds**: Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance
- **Modern variants**: MEGA65, ZX Spectrum Next, Amiga Vampire

### Languages
- **Assembly**: Primary focus across all systems
- **C**: "When it makes sense" (especially for 32/64-bit era)
- **BASIC**: Gateway language for home computers only

## Technical Details

- Expanded presentation from 32 to 33 slides (added system examples slide)
- All slides pass overflow validation
- Font sizes: 42pt-54pt for updated slides
- Total presentation: 33 slides

## Files

- `final-updated-scope.pptx` (workspace)
- `/Users/stevehill/Desktop/Code Like It's 198x - Updated.pptx` ✅ LATEST
- `replacement-text-updated-scope-final.json` (final replacement text)

## Narrative Flow

**Slide 10**: "71 systems... dawn to PS2 era... 8 to 64 bits"
↓
**Slide 11**: "Atari 2600 to PS2, Game Boy to Dreamcast" (concrete examples)
↓
**Slide 12**: "Starting with C64: 8,256 lessons, 100+ games"
↓
...pathway explanation...
↓
**Slide 20**: "MEGA65, ZX Spectrum Next, Amiga Vampire" (modern hardware)
↓
**Slide 21**: "Consoles: Assembly from day one. C when it makes sense."

## Impact

The presentation now accurately communicates:
- ✅ **30 years of computing**, not 18
- ✅ **Up to 64-bit**, not just 16-bit
- ✅ **PS2/Dreamcast era**, not stopping at SNES
- ✅ **C language acknowledgment** for appropriate systems
- ✅ **Poetic system examples** that span the full range
- ✅ **Modern hardware variants** as expansion options

Much more ambitious and exciting scope!
