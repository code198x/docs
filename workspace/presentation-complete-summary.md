# Complete Presentation Summary

## Final Statistics
- **Total slides**: 34 (started with 57 in original, went to 31, then expanded to 34)
- **Reduction from original**: 40% fewer slides
- **New content**: 100% rewritten with game-first focus
- **File size**: 2.1 MB
- **Estimated duration**: ~25 minutes at 45 seconds per slide

## Major Changes from Original

### 1. Removed Title Slide
**Old**: Started with "Code Like It's 198x" title
**New**: Jumps straight into "Once upon a time..." story
**Impact**: Logo reveal becomes a dramatic moment after emotional setup (slide 8)

### 2. Completely Rewrote Personal Introduction (Slides 1-7)
**Old intro** (5 slides):
- "I'm going to tell you a story"
- "Kid watched dad code Hangman"
- "Sparked a dream. Didn't quite happen. But close enough." ❌ Vague
- "Programming feels mystical..." ❌ Disconnected
- "Going back to <0.1% RAM"

**New intro** (7 slides):
- Cinematic scene-setting: "Once upon a time, living room, TV, C64 on floor"
- Character introduction: "Young boy. Older man. Thick book of code. Typing."
- Magic moment: "Line by line, a game took shape. Hangman. Character-based gallows."
- Impact: "To that boy, it was magic."
- Dream: "That magic sparked a dream. A dream of making games."
- Journey: "Boy grew up. Became software engineer. But the dream? Never faded."
- Commitment: "Now it's time to make it real."

**Why better**: Show, don't tell. Concrete sensory details. Clear emotional arc.

### 3. Updated Scope (Slides 10-11)
**Old**:
```
71 vintage systems.
8-bit to 16-bit.
1977-1995.
```

**New**:
```
Slide 10:
71 systems.
From the dawn of home computing
to the PS2 era.
8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit.

Slide 11:
From Atari 2600
to PlayStation 2.
From Game Boy
to Dreamcast.
```

**Impact**: 30 years (not 18), up to 64-bit (not 16-bit), includes handhelds

### 4. Updated Modern Hardware (Slide 20)
**Old**:
```
MEGA65.
ZX Spectrum Next.
Amiga Vampire.
```

**New**:
```
MEGA65.

```

**Impact**: Hints at broader ecosystem (Analogue Duo, SX-2, A2FPGA, etc.)

### 5. Updated Console Path (Slide 21)
**Old**:
```
NES, Master System, Genesis:
No BASIC.
Jump straight to assembly.
```

**New**:
```
Consoles: No BASIC.
NES. Genesis. PlayStation.
Assembly from day one.
C when it makes sense.
```

**Impact**: Spans generations, acknowledges C language for 32/64-bit era

### 6. Added The Vault (Slide 29) ✨ NEW
```
The Vault:
Encyclopedia of retro gaming.
Games. Creators. Machines.
Cultural context. Everything.
```

**What it is**:
- Comprehensive encyclopedia of retro gaming
- Games, creators, studios, publishers
- Hardware, manufacturers, CPUs, components
- Cultural/historical context (Miners' Strike games, Cold War influences)
- Everything interconnected

**Why it matters**: Unique differentiator. No other course has this.

### 7. Added Pattern Library (Slide 24)
**Old**:
```
Portfolio of
100+ complete games.
Deep hardware mastery.
Assembly expertise.
```

**New**:
```
Portfolio of
100+ complete games.
Deep hardware mastery.
Assembly expertise.
Pattern library access.
```

**Impact**: Concrete tangible benefit, reusable code routines

## Font Size Adaptations

Due to template text box constraints, various font sizes were needed:
- **Intro slides**: 34pt-72pt (smaller boxes due to template choice)
- **Main content**: 38pt-66pt (varied based on line count)
- **Smallest**: 22pt (slide 32, 4 dense lines)
- **Largest**: 72pt (2-line slides like "To that boy, it was magic")

All slides pass overflow validation.
