# Code Like It's 198x - Improved Presentation Outline

## Target: ~36 slides (down from 57)

### Section 1: The Hook (Personal Story) - 8 slides
1. **Title**: "Code Like It's 198x"
2. **Opening**: "I'm going to tell you a story..."
3. **The Moment**: "About a kid who watched his dad code Hangman..." [with magic image]
4. **The Spark**: "That feeling sparked a desire to learn."
5. **The Dream**: "That kid grew up wanting to make games."
6. **Reality Check**: "That never quite happened. But close enough."
7. **The Problem**: "Lately, programming feels more mystical than ever. Can you truly understand everything your code does?"
8. **The Solution**: "So I'm going back to when computers had <0.1% of today's RAM. When every byte counted." [with retro computer image]

### Section 2: The Vision - 5 slides
9. **Logo Reveal**: [Code Like It's 198x logo]
10. **The Scope**: "71 vintage systems. 8-bit to 16-bit. Computers and consoles. 1977-1995."
11. **Starting Point**: "Starting with the Commodore 64: 8,256 lessons teaching 100+ complete games."
12. **The Innovation**: "Not textbook theory. Not 'Hello World'. Build actual games from lesson 1."
13. **Different Paths**: "Home computers: BASIC → Assembly. Consoles: Straight to the metal. Same goal: Build games."

### Section 3: How It Works (C64 Example) - 8 slides
14. **C64 Path**: "Home computers had BASIC. Let's use that."
15. **Phase 0**: "64 BASIC lessons = 16 complete games. Build. Improve. Hit the ceiling."
16. **The Ceiling**: "Lessons 49-64: Try professional techniques. Watch BASIC fail. 6-8 fps. Raster jitter."
17. **The Motivation**: "You've built 16 games. You know what's possible. You've hit the limits. Now you WANT assembly."
18. **Phase 1-16**: "8,192 assembly lessons. 100+ games. Pong → Platformers → RPGs → Shoot-em-ups."
19. **Beyond Commercial**: "Not just 1980s games. Demoscene tricks. Modern techniques discovered since. State-of-the-art retro."
20. **Modern Hardware**: "MEGA65. ZX Spectrum Next. Amiga Vampire. Original + expanded hardware. Push the limits further."
21. **Console Path**: "NES, Master System, Genesis: No BASIC. Jump straight to assembly. Same goals: Beyond commercial."

### Section 4: Why This Matters - 7 slides
22. **Self-Directed**: "No instructor. No bootcamp fees. No waiting for cohorts. Start today. Learn at your pace."
23. **Prerequisites**: "None. Absolute beginners welcome. Kids can start. Experienced devs can jump ahead."
24. **Tangible Outcomes**: "Portfolio of 100+ complete games. Deep hardware mastery. Assembly expertise. Real systems programming skills."
25. **Pedagogy**: "Game-first learning. Discover concepts through necessity, not lectures."
26. **Discipline**: "Every byte counts. Every clock cycle matters. Think like a systems engineer."
27. **Joy**: "Blinking pixels and beeper tunes still feel like magic." [with retro game screenshot]
28. **Scope**: "71 systems. Original + modern. C64 → MEGA65. ZX Spectrum → Next. Amiga → Vampire." [with system logos grid]

### Section 5: Get Involved - 6 slides
29. **Free Forever**: "100% free. 100% open source. Always. GitHub: MIT licensed. Content: Creative Commons."

30. **Support**: "Like it? GitHub Sponsors. Patreon. Maybe t-shirts later. Keep it sustainable."

31. **Community**: "Discord for chat. GitHub Discussions for Q&A. Share your games. Learn together."

32. **Current Status**: "C64 curriculum: 8,256 lessons designed. Lessons 1-16 live. More coming weekly."

33. **Try It**: "code198x.stevehill.xyz - Start lesson 1 today"

34. **Contribute**:
    - "Test the lessons, report bugs"
    - "Tell me about your childhood machine"
    - "Try it with your kids"
    - "Help build the next 70 systems"

### Section 6: Closer - 2 slides
35. **The Promise**: "From lesson 1 to beyond commercial. From 1980s limits to 2025 techniques. From magic to mastery."

36. **Thanks**: "Thanks!" [with contact/links: Discord, GitHub, Patreon, website]

## Key Changes from Original:
- **Tighter**: 36 slides vs 57 (37% reduction)
- **Added**: 71 systems scope, 8,256 C64 lessons, game-first pedagogy
- **Added**: Concrete examples (16 BASIC games, 100+ assembly games)
- **Added**: The pedagogical hook (BASIC limits → Assembly power for home computers)
- **Added**: Different paths explained (BASIC for home computers, pure assembly for consoles)
- **Added**: Beyond commercial—demoscene tricks, modern techniques, state-of-the-art retro
- **Added**: Modern/expanded hardware (MEGA65, ZX Spectrum Next, Amiga Vampire)
- **Added**: Self-directed learning (no instructor, no bootcamp fees)
- **Added**: Prerequisites: None (beginners and kids welcome)
- **Added**: Tangible outcomes (100+ game portfolio, assembly expertise, systems programming skills)
- **Added**: Free forever, open source, with sponsorship model
- **Added**: Community (Discord, GitHub Discussions)
- **Removed**: Repetitive "why am I doing this" slides
- **Streamlined**: Personal story from 18 slides to 8
- **Focused**: More concrete details, less philosophical musing

## Design Approach:
- **Retro aesthetic**: CRT green/amber palette, pixelated accents
- **Bold typography**: Large headers, minimal body text
- **Visual breaks**: Use images/icons strategically (not on every slide)
- **Data visualization**: System logos grid, lesson progression diagram
