# Final Presentation Changes - Title Slide Removal

## What Changed

**Removed**: Title slide "Code Like It's 198x" at the beginning
**Result**: Presentation now jumps straight into the story

## New Opening Sequence (30 slides total)

### Slide 1 (was Slide 2):
```
I'm going to tell
you a story…
```
**Impact**: Immediate hook, no preamble

### Slide 2 (was Slide 3):
```
About a kid who once
watched his dad
code a version of
Hangman…
```
**Impact**: Personal narrative begins

### Slides 3-5 (were Slides 4-6):
Personal story continues through:
- Dream to make games
- Modern programming complexity
- Going back to retro computing

### Slide 6 (was Slide 7):
**[Visual-only slide with logo]**
**Impact**: First appearance of "Code Like It's 198x" - revealed through visual, not text
**Timing**: After 5 slides of story setup, the name reveal has context and impact

### Slide 7 onwards (were Slides 8+):
Vision and scope begin with "71 vintage systems..."

## Why This Works Better

1. **Stronger Hook**: Audience doesn't know where this is going
2. **Dramatic Reveal**: Project name appears after story context is established
3. **Visual Impact**: Logo reveal on slide 6 becomes a "reveal moment"
4. **No Spoilers**: Title slide was giving away the punchline before the joke
5. **Tighter Pacing**: 30 slides vs 31, cleaner flow

## Story Arc

**Before:**
1. Title reveal (spoils it)
2. "I'm going to tell you a story" (why? we know what this is about)
3. Story begins...

**After:**
1. "I'm going to tell you a story" (intrigue - what story?)
2. Personal narrative builds...
3. Problem presented...
4. Solution hinted at...
5. **BOOM** - Logo reveal (oh, THIS is what you're building!)
6. Scope and details follow
