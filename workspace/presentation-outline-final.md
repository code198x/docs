# Code Like It's 198x - Final Presentation Outline

## 31 slides (46% reduction from 57)

### Section 1: The Hook (Personal Story) - 6 slides
1. **Title**: "Code Like It's 198x"
2. **Opening**: "I'm going to tell you a story..."
3. **The Moment**: "About a kid who watched his dad code Hangman..." [with magic image]
4. **The Journey**: "That sparked a dream to make games. Didn't quite happen. But close enough."
5. **The Problem**: "Lately, programming feels more mystical than ever. Can you truly understand everything your code does?"
6. **The Solution**: "So I'm going back to when computers had <0.1% of today's RAM. When every byte counted." [with retro computer image]

### Section 2: The Vision - 4 slides
7. **Logo Reveal**: [Code Like It's 198x logo]
8. **The Scope**: "71 vintage systems. 8-bit to 16-bit. Computers and consoles. 1977-1995. Original + modern hardware."
9. **Starting Point**: "Starting with C64: 8,256 lessons, 100+ complete games. MEGA65. ZX Spectrum → Next. Amiga → Vampire."
10. **Different Paths**: "Home computers: BASIC → Assembly. Consoles: Straight to the metal. Build games from lesson 1."

### Section 3: How It Works (C64 Example) - 8 slides
11. **C64 Path**: "Home computers had BASIC. Let's use that."
12. **Phase 0**: "64 BASIC lessons = 16 complete games. Build. Improve. Hit the ceiling."
13. **The Ceiling**: "Lessons 49-64: Try professional techniques. Watch BASIC fail. 6-8 fps. Raster jitter."
14. **The Motivation**: "You've built 16 games. You know what's possible. You've hit the limits. Now you WANT assembly."
15. **Phase 1-16**: "8,192 assembly lessons. 100+ games. Pong → Platformers → RPGs → Shoot-em-ups."
16. **Beyond Commercial**: "Not just 1980s games. Demoscene tricks. Modern techniques discovered since. State-of-the-art retro."
17. **Modern Hardware**: "MEGA65. ZX Spectrum Next. Amiga Vampire. Original + expanded hardware. Push the limits further."
18. **Console Path**: "NES, Master System, Genesis: No BASIC. Jump straight to assembly. Same goals: Beyond commercial."

### Section 4: Why This Matters - 6 slides
19. **Self-Directed**: "No instructor. No bootcamp fees. No waiting for cohorts. Start today. Learn at your pace."
20. **Prerequisites**: "None. Absolute beginners welcome. Kids can start. Experienced devs can jump ahead."
21. **Tangible Outcomes**: "Portfolio of 100+ complete games. Deep hardware mastery. Assembly expertise. Real systems programming skills."
22. **Pedagogy**: "Game-first learning. Discover concepts through necessity, not lectures."
23. **Discipline**: "Every byte counts. Every clock cycle matters. Think like a systems engineer."
24. **Joy**: "Blinking pixels and beeper tunes still feel like magic." [with retro game screenshot]

### Section 5: Get Involved - 5 slides
25. **Free Forever**: "100% free. 100% open source. Always. GitHub: MIT licensed. Content: Creative Commons."
26. **Support**: "Like it? GitHub Sponsors. Patreon. Maybe t-shirts later. Keep it sustainable."
27. **Community**: "Discord for chat. GitHub Discussions for Q&A. Share your games. Learn together."
28. **Start Now**: "Lessons 1-16 live. More weekly. code198x.stevehill.xyz - Start lesson 1 today."
29. **Contribute**:
    - "Test the lessons, report bugs"
    - "Tell me about your childhood machine"
    - "Try it with your kids"
    - "Help build the next 70 systems"

### Section 6: Closer - 2 slides
30. **The Promise**: "From lesson 1 to beyond commercial. From 1980s limits to 2025 techniques. From magic to mastery."
31. **Thanks**: "Thanks!" [with contact/links: Discord, GitHub, Patreon, website]

## Changes from Previous Draft:
- **Slides 4-6 merged** → Slide 4: Combined personal journey beats
- **Slides 10-11 merged** → Slide 9: Scope + starting point combined
- **Slide 28 removed**: Modern hardware scope moved to slide 9, saves redundancy
- **Slides 32-33 merged** → Slide 28: Status + Try it combined
- **Total**: 31 slides (down from 36)

## Final Statistics:
- **Original**: 57 slides
- **Final**: 31 slides
- **Reduction**: 46%
- **Average**: ~45 seconds per slide = ~23 minute presentation

## Key Messages Retained:
✅ Personal story hook (6 slides)
✅ Massive scope (71 systems, original + modern)
✅ C64 specifics (8,256 lessons, 100+ games, game-first)
✅ BASIC → Assembly progression
✅ Beyond commercial quality (demoscene, modern techniques)
✅ Self-directed, no prerequisites, tangible outcomes
✅ Free forever, open source, community-driven
✅ Clear calls to action (try it, support it, contribute)

## Design Approach:
- **Retro aesthetic**: CRT green/amber palette, pixelated accents
- **Bold typography**: Large headers, minimal body text per slide
- **Visual breaks**: Strategic use of images (magic moment, retro game, system logos)
- **Pacing**: Personal story → Vision → How it works → Why it matters → Get involved → Close
