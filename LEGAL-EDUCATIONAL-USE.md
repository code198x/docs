**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Applies To:** All Code Like It's 198x curriculum materials

## Summary

**This curriculum uses classic game names as LEARNING REFERENCES only.**

Students do NOT build clones or reproductions of commercial games. Students build **original games inspired by classic mechanics** using their own code, graphics, sounds, and designs.

---

## What This Means

### When the curriculum says "Build Tetris"

**It means:**
- Build an original falling-block puzzle game
- Implement rotation algorithms and line-clearing mechanics
- Create your own name (e.g., "Block Drop," "Gravity Puzzle")
- Design your own graphics and block shapes
- Write your own original code
- Use your own sound effects and music

**It does NOT mean:**
- Clone the Tetris game
- Use Tetris trademark or name
- Copy Tetromino shapes (these are trademarked!)
- Reproduce Tetris assets, code, or presentation
- Violate The Tetris Company's intellectual property

### General Principle

**Reference Game:** Street Fighter II
**What Students Build:** An original 1v1 fighting game with:
- Special move input system (original implementation)
- Combo mechanics (original design)
- Original characters, names, graphics, and presentation
- Completely original codebase

**What Students Learn:** Frame data, hitboxes, input buffering, combo systems
**What Students Create:** An original fighting game demonstrating those techniques

## Educational Fair Use

This curriculum references classic games for **educational purposes**:

1. **Teaching game development concepts** - rotation algorithms, AI patterns, physics systems
2. **Historical context** - understanding how classic games solved technical problems
3. **Design inspiration** - learning what makes certain game mechanics effective
4. **Technical reference** - understanding techniques used in classic implementations

**No commercial games, assets, code, or trademarks are reproduced or distributed.**

---

## Student Responsibilities

Students using this curriculum agree to:

1. **Create original work** - All code, graphics, sounds, and designs must be original
2. **Use original names** - Do not use trademarked game titles
3. **Avoid trademark infringement** - Do not use recognizable characters, logos, or branding
4. **No asset copying** - Do not extract or reproduce graphics, sounds, or music from commercial games
5. **Understand fair use** - Reference games are learning tools, not templates to copy

## Examples of Acceptable vs. Unacceptable

### ✅ ACCEPTABLE

**Lesson Goal:** "Build a Pac-Man-style maze chase game"

**Student Creates:**
- Game called "Maze Muncher" or "Dot Gobbler"
- Original maze layouts
- Original character sprites (different from Pac-Man ghosts)
- Original ghost AI using chase/scatter patterns
- Original sound effects and music
- All code written from scratch

**What Student Learned:** Pathfinding, state machines, maze navigation, power-up systems

---

### ❌ UNACCEPTABLE

**Student Creates:**
- Game called "Pac-Man" or "Pacman"
- Exact reproduction of original maze layouts
- Copied or traced sprites from Pac-Man
- Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde ghost names
- Extracted audio from commercial game
- Decompiled or copied original game code

**This violates:** Trademark, copyright, and intellectual property laws

---

## Why Classic Games Are Referenced

### Pedagogical Reasons

1. **Shared Understanding** - "Tetris-style puzzle game" immediately communicates the learning objective
2. **Technical Benchmarks** - Classic games represent solved technical challenges
3. **Design Patterns** - Proven mechanics demonstrate effective game design
4. **Historical Context** - Understanding the C64 era requires familiarity with its games

### What Students Actually Build

- **100+ original games** across all genres
- **Original implementations** of classic mechanics
- **Personal portfolio** of complete, playable games
- **Transferable skills** applicable to any game development

## Questions?

**Q: Can I sell games I create using this curriculum?**
A: Yes, if they are completely original (code, graphics, sounds, names, presentation). No, if they clone or reproduce commercial games.

**Q: Can I use the name "Tetris-style" in my game description?**
A: Use with caution. Descriptive use ("a falling-block puzzle game") is safer than using trademarked names.

**Q: Can I study original game code to understand how it works?**
A: For personal learning, yes. But your implementation must be original, not copied or derivative.

**Q: Can I make a game that plays similarly to a classic game?**
A: Game mechanics generally cannot be copyrighted, but presentation can be. Your game can use similar mechanics if implemented originally with unique presentation.

**Q: What if I want to make an actual Tetris clone?**
A: That's outside the scope of this educational curriculum. Contact The Tetris Company for licensing.
