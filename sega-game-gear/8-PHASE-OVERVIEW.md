## Curriculum Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Game-First Development**
- Every lesson improves an actual, playable game
- No abstract exercises or theoretical concepts in isolation
- Milestones: Playable → Complete → Polished → Professional

**2. Spiral Learning**
- Games revisited multiple times across phases at increasing complexity
- Students directly compare basic vs advanced Game Gear techniques
- Clear progression shows growth and mastery

**3. Pattern Library**
- Core techniques taught once, documented, then reused
- "VDP programming is VDP programming" - same concept, increasingly optimized
- Avoid teaching from scratch every time

**4. Genre Techniques, Not Recreations**
- Teach techniques applicable to game genres (within portable constraints)
- Not recreating specific classic games (though students learn their techniques)
- Students learn transferable skills

**5. Progressive Hardware Mastery**
- Phase 1-2: Master Game Gear base (Z80, VDP, PSG, portable color)
- Phase 3: **Advanced Game Gear mastery** - all techniques, portable optimization
- Phase 4-6: Advanced techniques, pushing Game Gear limits
- Phase 7: **Maximum Game Gear** - all capabilities, professional development
- Phase 8: Modern Game Gear development (homebrew scene)
