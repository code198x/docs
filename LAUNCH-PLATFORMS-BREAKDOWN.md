# Launch Platforms Breakdown

**Eight platforms for initial focus:** C64, ZX Spectrum, NES, Amiga, Genesis, Atari 2600, BBC Micro, Game Boy

These eight platforms provide:
- **Three CPU families** (6502: C64/NES/BBC/2600, Z80: Spectrum/Game Boy, 68000: Amiga/Genesis)
- **Three eras** (Late 70s: 2600, Early 80s: Spectrum/BBC, Mid 80s: C64/NES, Late 80s: Genesis/Amiga/Game Boy)
- **Four form factors** (Computers: C64/Spectrum/BBC/Amiga, Consoles: NES/Genesis/2600, Handheld: Game Boy)
- **Diverse cultural contexts** (UK bedroom/education, US early console, Japan console dominance, worldwide handheld)
- **Technical variety** (extreme constraints to 16-bit power, software sprites to hardware sprites)
- **Clear pattern transfer opportunities** within CPU families
- **Maximum architectural variety** with manageable scope

**CRITICAL:** All student-created games are 100% original with original names. The Vault documents historical games for reference, but what students build is entirely new work that does not conflict with any existing game names or trademarks.

## 6. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

### Launch Content (12-18 months):

**Deep platforms:**
- C64: Phase 0-2 complete (~1,000 lessons, 10-12 games)
- Spectrum: Phase 0-1 complete (~500 lessons, 10-12 games)
- NES: Phase 1 complete (~250 lessons, 8-10 games)

**Substantial platforms:**
- BBC Micro: Phase 0-1 (~400 lessons, 8-10 games)
- Game Boy: Phase 1 (~250 lessons, 8-10 games)

**Showcase platforms:**
- Amiga: ~125 lessons, 6-8 games
- Genesis: ~125 lessons, 6-8 games
- 2600: ~75 lessons, 6-8 games

**Total: ~2,725 lessons across 8 platforms**

**Original games: ~68-86 complete games** (all 100% original)
