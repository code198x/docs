## Phase Details

### Phase 0: BASIC Introduction (64 lessons)

**Structure:** 4 tiers × 16 lessons (game-first approach)
**Outcome:** 16 complete games, programming fundamentals through gameplay, natural discovery of BASIC's limits

**Tier 1 (L1-16):** 6 foundation games (5-60 lines) - Discovery
**Tier 2 (L17-32):** 4 technical games (25-150 lines) - Building (sprites, sound, physics)
**Tier 3 (L33-48):** 3 professional games (45-280 lines) - Mastery (platformer, RPG, puzzle)
**Tier 4 (L49-64):** 3 ceiling demos (80-250 lines) - Explicit BASIC limits demonstration

See [commodore-64/PHASE-0-CURRICULUM-GAME-FIRST.md](commodore-64/PHASE-0-CURRICULUM-GAME-FIRST.md) for complete details.

---

### Phase 1: Assembly + Hardware Fundamentals (512 lessons)

**Structure:** 16 tiers × 32 lessons
**Games Built:** Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, Galaxian, Asteroids, Missile Command, Defender, Scramble, Zaxxon, Dig Dug, Q*bert, Frogger, Donkey Kong, Mario Bros, Pac-Man, Centipede

**What Students Master:**
- 6510 assembly language fundamentals
- VIC-II basics (sprites, colors, collision)
- CIA basics (joystick, keyboard)
- SID basics (simple sound effects)
- Game loop architecture
- Simple physics (velocity, acceleration)
- Collision detection (AABB)
- Score and lives systems
- Screen scrolling basics

**Why 512 lessons:** These 16 arcade classics form the foundation. Each game introduces new concepts while reinforcing previous ones. Moving from Pong (32 lessons) to Centipede (32 lessons) represents a complete journey from "first sprite" to "complex multi-element games."

See [PHASE-1-CURRICULUM.md](PHASE-1-CURRICULUM.md) for complete details.

## Curriculum Design Principles

### Why This Structure Works

**1. Game-Driven Throughout**
Every lesson builds actual games. No abstract exercises or "draw a sprite" busywork.

**2. Progressive Complexity**
Pong (32 lessons) → Centipede (32 lessons) → Contra (64 lessons) → Pirates! (128 lessons)

**3. Genre Families Get Proper Depth**
- Shooters: 1024 lessons (defining C64 genre)
- RPGs: 1024 lessons (most complex systems)
- Everything else: 384-512 lessons based on complexity

**4. No Artificial Padding**
Lesson counts match genuine complexity, not arbitrary targets.

**5. Self-Directed Throughout**
Every project is concrete. No "design your own game" that requires instructor feedback.

**6. Authentic References**
Only games that existed (or could have) on C64 with period-appropriate techniques.

**7. Mastery Through Repetition**
Build 16 shooters, 8 RPGs, 8 platformers—expertise comes from doing, repeatedly.

**8. Integration Before Mastery**
Final phases synthesize all skills into ultimate challenges.
