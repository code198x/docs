## Phase 1 Complete

Over 16 units, you've built the foundation of Neon Nexus. Let's review what's working:

**Core Systems:**
- Player movement with boundary checking
- Multiple enemies with different movement patterns
- Collision detection using bounding boxes
- Collectible items with random respawn

**Game State:**
- Lives system with invulnerability
- Score tracking and HUD display
- Title screen with "PRESS START"
- Game over screen with final score
- State machine managing transitions

**Polish:**
- Sound effects for collecting and getting hit
- Player sprite flashing during invulnerability
- VBlank-safe PPU updates
- Efficient dirty flag system

## Phase 1 Journey

| Unit | Topic | What You Learnt |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Hello NES | iNES header, PPU basics, first ROM |
| 2 | Drawing Tiles | CHR-ROM, pattern tables, nametables |
| 3 | Palette | Colour palettes, attribute tables |
| 4 | Sprites | OAM, shadow buffer, DMA transfer |
| 5 | Movement | Controller input, position updates |
| 6 | Boundaries | Screen edge detection, clamping |
| 7 | Animation | Frame counting, tile cycling |
| 8 | Enemies | Multiple sprites, movement patterns |
| 9 | Collision | Bounding box, absolute distance |
| 10 | Collectibles | Items, random placement, scoring |
| 11 | Score Display | VBlank updates, dirty flags, BCD |
| 12 | Lives | Counters, invulnerability, flashing |
| 13 | Enemy Patterns | Data-driven movement, dispatcher |
| 14 | Sound Effects | APU, pulse channel, pitch sweeps |
| 15 | Title Screen | Game states, state machine |
| 16 | Review | Phase 1 complete |

## Technical Foundation

You now understand:

- **Memory-mapped I/O**: How the NES communicates with its PPU and APU through specific addresses
- **VBlank timing**: Why we can only update the PPU during vertical blank
- **Sprite handling**: How 64 sprites share shadow OAM and get DMA'd to the PPU
- **Sound synthesis**: How period values create different pitches on the APU
- **Game architecture**: How state machines organise complex game logic

## The Phase 1 Code

Here's the complete Phase 1 version of Neon Nexus:

<CodeFromFile src="nintendo-entertainment-system/game-01-neon-nexus/unit-16/nexus.asm" />

## Build It

```bash
ca65 nexus.asm -o nexus.o
ld65 -C nes.cfg nexus.o -o nexus.nes
```

Your Phase 1 game:

This ROM runs on real NES hardware. You've written code that would work on a cartridge from 1985.

## What's Next: Phase 2

Phase 1 gave you the foundation. Phase 2 expands on it:

- **Background graphics**: Drawing the playfield with tiles
- **Attribute tables**: Colouring different screen regions
- **Level design**: Creating distinct play areas
- **Difficulty progression**: Making the game harder over time
- **High scores**: Tracking and displaying best performances
- **More enemy types**: Expanding the threat variety

The single-screen action game becomes richer and more polished.

## Three Phases Remain

| Phase | Units | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Phase 2 | 17-32 | Background graphics, levels, difficulty |
| Phase 3 | 33-48 | Advanced features, optimisation |
| Phase 4 | 49-64 | Final polish, release quality |

By Unit 64, Neon Nexus will be a complete, polished game worthy of a real cartridge.

## Phase 1 Achievement

You've built a playable game in 6502 assembly. Not a tutorial exercise — actual machine code that controls hardware from 1985.

The foundation is solid. Now we build on it.

See you in Phase 2.
