*Need to catch up? Check out [Unit 1: First Sound](/commodore-64/assembly/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-01).*

## What You're Building

One voice made one sound. But the SID has *three* voices — three independent sound generators that can play simultaneously. That's not just three times louder. That's harmony. That's chords. That's music.

By the end of this unit, you'll have:

- All three SID voices playing together
- A C major chord ringing out (C-E-G)
- Three different waveforms, each with its own character
- Understanding of how voices combine

Listen to the result. That's not a beep — that's a *chord*.

## Voice Register Offsets

Each SID voice has seven registers. Voice 1 starts at $D400, but where are the others?

Simple arithmetic: each voice occupies 7 bytes, so the voices are 7 bytes apart:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-02/snippets/01-voice-offsets.asm" />

Voice 1 at $D400, Voice 2 at $D407, Voice 3 at $D40E. The register layout is identical — only the base address changes.

## The Four Waveforms

The SID can generate four fundamentally different waveforms. Each has a distinct sonic character:

| Waveform | Bit | Sound Character |
|----------|-----|-----------------|
| Triangle | $10 | Soft, pure, flute-like |
| Sawtooth | $20 | Bright, buzzy, string-like |
| Pulse | $40 | Hollow, reedy, organ-like |
| Noise | $80 | Unpitched, percussive, static |

The waveform is selected in the control register, combined with the gate bit:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-02/snippets/02-waveform-bits.asm" />

<InlineNote>
You can only select *one* waveform at a time (setting multiple bits produces unusual, often harsh, sounds — interesting for experimentation, but not for music).

## Building a Chord

A chord is multiple notes that sound good together. The simplest pleasant chord is a **major triad**: the root note, a major third above it, and a perfect fifth above it.

For C major: C, E, and G.

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-02/snippets/03-chord-frequencies.asm" />

We'll build a proper frequency table in Unit 4. For now, these three values give us a clean C major chord.

## Configuring Each Voice

Each voice needs the same setup: frequency, envelope, waveform, and gate. The only differences are the frequency value and the waveform selection:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-02/snippets/04-configure-voice.asm" />

We give each voice a different waveform so you can hear them individually within the chord:
- Voice 1 (C): Triangle — the soft foundation
- Voice 2 (E): Sawtooth — the bright third
- Voice 3 (G): Pulse — the hollow fifth

## Pulse Width

The pulse waveform has an extra parameter: **pulse width**. This controls the ratio of "high" to "low" in each cycle.

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-02/snippets/05-pulse-width.asm" />

- 50% ($0800) — Balanced, hollow square wave
- 25% ($0400) — Thinner, more nasal
- 10% ($0199) — Very thin, almost filtered

Triangle and sawtooth don't use pulse width. Noise ignores both pulse width and frequency (it's just random).

## How Voices Combine

When multiple voices play simultaneously, the SID adds their outputs together. Three voices at full sustain won't be three times as loud — the SID has a single output that clips if overdriven.

For clean mixing:
- Use similar sustain levels across voices
- Vary waveforms for distinct voices
- Space frequencies apart (don't play the same note on multiple voices)

## Build It. Run It.

```bash
acme -f cbm -o symphony.prg symphony.asm
x64sc symphony.prg
```

You'll see a black screen. But *listen*. That's a chord — three distinct tones harmonising together.

Try these experiments:
1. Change Voice 2's waveform from sawtooth to triangle — hear how the chord becomes softer
2. Change Voice 3's pulse width to $0400 — hear how it becomes thinner
3. Set all three to the same waveform — hear how they blend into one sound

## What You've Learnt

- **Voice offsets**: +7 bytes per voice ($D400, $D407, $D40E)
- **Waveform selection**: Triangle ($10), Sawtooth ($20), Pulse ($40), Noise ($80)
- **Pulse width**: 12-bit value controlling pulse wave duty cycle
- **Voice mixing**: The SID sums all voices to a single output

## Next Unit

We've played sounds, we've played chords. But they're all the same shape — instant on, sustained, instant off. Real instruments don't work that way. A piano note swells and fades. A drum hits and decays. A string sustains then releases.

In Unit 3, we explore ADSR envelopes in depth — shaping sounds from harsh stabs to soft pads.
