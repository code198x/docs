## What Is "Juice"?

Game designers use "juice" to describe the small visual and audio effects that make games feel satisfying. A button press that does nothing visible feels unresponsive. The same button press with a screen flash, sound effect, and particle burst feels *powerful*.

We already have audio feedback. Now we add visual punch.

## The Border Register

The C64's border colour lives at `$D020`. Changing this single byte transforms the entire screen surround:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-12/snippets/01-the-border-register.asm" lang="asm" />

We'll flash the border on key moments: cyan when the multiplier increases, red when the player misses.

## Effect Timers

Each visual effect needs a timer. When triggered, we set the timer. Each frame, we decrement it. When it hits zero, the effect ends:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-12/snippets/02-effect-timers.asm" lang="asm" />

At 50 frames per second on PAL, 8 frames gives us roughly 160ms of flash — noticeable but not distracting.

## Triggering Effects

When the multiplier increases, we want celebration. Add the border flash trigger to the combo routine:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-12/snippets/03-triggering-effects.asm" lang="asm" />

The border flash only fires when the multiplier actually increases — making it feel special.

## Miss Feedback

Missing should feel bad. A red border flash reinforces the mistake:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-12/snippets/04-miss-feedback.asm" lang="asm" />

The miss flash is shorter than the multiplier flash. We want the player to notice, not to punish them with a long red screen.

## The Update Routine

Each frame, we check all effect timers and set the border colour accordingly:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-12/snippets/05-the-update-routine.asm" lang="asm" />

The priority matters: multiplier flash beats miss flash beats normal. If somehow both trigger simultaneously, the positive feedback wins.

## Integration

Add the update call to the game loop, after other updates:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-12/snippets/06-integration.asm" lang="asm" />

## Initialisation

Reset all effect timers when starting a new game:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-12/snippets/07-initialisation.asm" lang="asm" />

## The Feel Factor

These effects are subtle. You might not consciously notice them. But play the game with and without them — the difference is dramatic.

Good juice follows a principle: **reward success loudly, punish failure quietly**. The cyan multiplier flash is longer and brighter than the red miss flash. Players feel celebrated for achievement without feeling beaten down by mistakes.

## What's Next

The game now looks and sounds polished. In Unit 13, we add **difficulty progression** — making the song speed up as the player succeeds, keeping the challenge fresh.
