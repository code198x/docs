## The Need to Stop

Life interrupts. The phone rings. Someone knocks. The player needs to look away. Without pause, these moments become failures — missed notes, lost progress, frustration.

Pause is respect. It says "take your time, we'll wait." A small feature with outsized impact on player experience.

## A New State

We add a fifth game state:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-15/snippets/01-a-new-state.asm" lang="asm" />

The main loop needs to handle this new state:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-15/snippets/02-a-new-state.asm" lang="asm" />

## Entering Pause

At the start of the game update, we check for the P key. If pressed, we silence audio, show the pause text, and switch states:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-15/snippets/03-entering-pause.asm" lang="asm" />

The early `rts` is important — we exit immediately after pausing. No further game logic runs.

## The Pause Loop

While paused, we do almost nothing. Just wait for P to be pressed again:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-15/snippets/04-the-pause-loop.asm" lang="asm" />

This is the same edge-detection pattern we use for all keys — track the previous state to detect transitions, not held keys.

## Reading the P Key

The C64 keyboard matrix puts P on row 5 (bit 5), column 1 (bit 1):

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-15/snippets/05-reading-the-p-key.asm" lang="asm" />

## Visual Feedback

Players need to know they're paused. We draw "PAUSED" in the centre of the screen:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-15/snippets/06-visual-feedback.asm" lang="asm" />

Yellow stands out against the game's cyan and black palette. The text appears on row 11 — between the tracks, clearly visible but not obscuring gameplay elements.

## What Pause Preserves

When we pause, everything freezes in place:

- **Note positions**: Notes stay where they are
- **Score and streak**: Progress is preserved
- **Multiplier**: No penalty for pausing
- **Crowd meter**: Doesn't decay
- **Song position**: Resumes from the same beat

We achieve this by simply not calling any update routines while paused. The game state variables persist unchanged.

## What Pause Stops

We explicitly silence audio:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-15/snippets/07-what-pause-stops.asm" lang="asm" />

Without this, any playing notes would sustain forever. The `silence_sid` routine gates off all three voices.

## Design Decisions

**Why P for pause?** It's intuitive (P for Pause) and not used for gameplay. Space is taken by the title screen, X/C/V are gameplay keys.

**Why not pause on any key?** Accidental pauses frustrate players. A dedicated key means intentional pauses only.

**Why not dim the screen?** Complexity without benefit. The "PAUSED" text is clear enough. Adding screen effects would require saving and restoring colour memory — more code for marginal gain.

## The Complete Code

## What's Next

The game is feature-complete. In Unit 16, we do a **final polish pass** — cleaning up code, optimising where it matters, and preparing the game for release.
