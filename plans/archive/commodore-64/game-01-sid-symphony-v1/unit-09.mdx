## The SID as Instrument

Until now, all three voices played the same waveform. Press X, C, or V — same sound, different pitch. That's functional, but it's not *musical*.

Real instruments have character. A piano sounds different from a guitar playing the same note. The SID chip can do this too. Each voice can have its own waveform, its own envelope, its own personality.

This unit transforms our rhythm game from "beeps when you press keys" to "sounds like you're playing an instrument."

## Waveforms: The Shape of Sound

The SID offers four waveforms, each with distinct character:

| Waveform | Bit | Character |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| Triangle | $10 | Pure, soft, flute-like |
| Sawtooth | $20 | Bright, buzzy, string-like |
| Pulse | $40 | Hollow to full, organ-like |
| Noise | $80 | Harsh, percussive, no pitch |

The control register combines the waveform bit with the gate bit ($01):

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-09/snippets/01-waveforms-the-shape-of-sound.asm" lang="asm" />

We assign each track its own waveform:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-09/snippets/02-waveforms-the-shape-of-sound.asm" lang="asm" />

Now each track sounds different. The top track (X) has a warm pulse wave, the middle (C) has a bright sawtooth, and the bottom (V) has a soft triangle.

## ADSR: Shaping the Note

ADSR stands for Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release. These four values shape how a note evolves over time:

- **Attack**: How quickly the sound reaches full volume (0=instant, F=slow)
- **Decay**: How quickly it drops to sustain level
- **Sustain**: Volume while key is held (0-F)
- **Release**: How quickly it fades after key release

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-09/snippets/03-adsr-shaping-the-note.asm" lang="asm" />

<InlineNote>
The pulse wave gets instant attack for a percussive feel. The triangle gets a slightly slower attack for a gentler sound. Experiment with these values — small changes dramatically affect the feel.

## The Filter: Adding Brightness

The SID has a multi-mode filter that all three voices can route through. For our hit feedback, we use a filter *sweep* — starting bright and fading darker.

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-09/snippets/04-the-filter-adding-brightness.asm" lang="asm" />

The cutoff frequency controls which frequencies pass through. Higher cutoff = brighter sound. Lower cutoff = darker, muffled sound.

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-09/snippets/05-the-filter-adding-brightness.asm" lang="asm" />

Every hit triggers `start_filter_sweep`, which sets the cutoff high. Each frame, `update_filter_sweep` gradually lowers it. The result: hits sound bright and present, then settle back to normal.

## The Bum Note: Audio Feedback for Misses

Visual feedback (red flash) tells you something went wrong. Audio feedback *makes you feel it*. When you miss a note, we briefly play a dissonant, ugly sound.

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-09/snippets/06-the-bum-note-audio-feedback-for-misses.asm" lang="asm" />

We temporarily hijack voice 1 to play noise. After 8 frames, `update_bum_note` restores the original settings.

## Build It. Run It.

Assemble and run:

```bash
acme -o symphony.prg symphony.asm
x64sc symphony.prg
```

The difference is immediate:

- Each track has character — pulse, sawtooth, triangle
- Hits feel bright and responsive (filter sweep)
- Misses feel *wrong* (bum note)
- The chord sounds full and musical

## What You've Learnt

- **Waveforms**: Each has distinct sonic character
- **ADSR envelopes**: Shape how notes evolve over time
- **Filter routing**: Use the SID filter for brightness control
- **Filter sweeps**: Animate the cutoff for impact

## Next Unit

The game sounds good, but we're treating all hits the same. In [Unit 10: Timing Grades](/commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-10), we add timing windows — different grades for Perfect, Good, and Late hits. Precision starts to matter.
