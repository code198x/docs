## The Value of Consistency

Timing grades reward precision on individual notes. But what about sustained excellence? A player who hits 50 notes in a row deserves more than someone who hits every other note.

Enter the combo system. Consecutive hits build a multiplier. More hits, bigger multiplier, higher scores. One miss resets everything. The pressure builds with every successful hit.

## The Multiplier Model

We use a simple progression:

| Hits | Multiplier | Colour |
|------|------------|--------|
| 0-9 | 1x | Grey |
| 10-19 | 2x | Yellow |
| 20-29 | 3x | Green |
| 30+ | 4x | Cyan |

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-11/snippets/01-the-multiplier-model.asm" lang="asm" />

Every 10 consecutive hits increases the multiplier. The combo counter resets to zero each time, so you need another 10 hits for the next level.

## Building the Combo

Every successful hit — Perfect, Good, or Late — calls the combo update routine:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-11/snippets/02-building-the-combo.asm" lang="asm" />

The logic is straightforward: increment the counter, check if we've hit the threshold, increase the multiplier if possible, reset the counter either way.

## Breaking the Combo

A miss devastates your progress. Both the combo counter and the multiplier reset to their starting values:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-11/snippets/03-breaking-the-combo.asm" lang="asm" />

This creates tension. That 4x multiplier took 30 consecutive hits to build. One mistake and it's gone. Players naturally become more careful as their multiplier climbs.

## Multiplication on the 6502

The 6502 has no multiply instruction. We implement multiplication through shifts and adds:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-11/snippets/04-multiplication-on-the-6502.asm" lang="asm" />

The `asl` (arithmetic shift left) instruction doubles a value. Two shifts give us 4x. For 3x, we shift once (2x) then add the original value (2x + 1x = 3x).

## Displaying the Multiplier

The multiplier appears on the score row, colour-coded by level:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-64/game-01-sid-symphony/unit-11/snippets/05-displaying-the-multiplier.asm" lang="asm" />

The colour progression provides instant feedback. Grey is baseline. Yellow means you're building. Green means you're doing well. Cyan means you're on fire — and one mistake away from losing it all.

## The Psychology

Watch how players behave with the combo system:

- At 1x: Relaxed, taking risks
- At 2x: Starting to focus
- At 3x: Visibly concentrating
- At 4x: Holding their breath

The multiplier doesn't just affect score — it affects how the game *feels*. That's the magic of risk/reward systems.

## Score Impact

With the multiplier, maximum scores increase dramatically:

| Grade | Base | 1x | 2x | 3x | 4x |
|-------|------|----|----|----|----|
| Perfect | 15 | 15 | 30 | 45 | 60 |
| Good | 10 | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 |
| Late | 5 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 |

A player maintaining 4x throughout scores four times higher than one who keeps missing. Skill is now clearly visible in the final score.

## What's Next

The combo system adds tension, but we can push the "feel" further. In Unit 12, we add **visual juice** — screen effects that make every hit feel impactful.
