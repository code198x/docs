Territory control is shown through colour. Red versus Blue—when a player claims a cell, it changes to their colour.

## Player Colour Constants

```asm
PLAYER1_ATTR equ %01010000   ; Bright red paper
PLAYER2_ATTR equ %01001000   ; Bright blue paper
EMPTY_ATTR   equ %00111000   ; White paper (unclaimed)
```

Breaking down the attribute bytes:

| Player | Binary | BRIGHT | PAPER | INK |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|-----|
| Player 1 | %01010000 | 1 | 010 (red) | 000 (black) |
| Player 2 | %01001000 | 1 | 001 (blue) | 000 (black) |
| Empty | %00111000 | 0 | 111 (white) | 000 (black) |

## Claiming a Cell

To claim a cell, calculate its address and write the player's colour:

```asm
    ; Player 1 claims cell at row 8, column 12 (top-left of board)
    ld hl, $5800 + (BOARD_TOP * 32) + BOARD_LEFT
    ld (hl), PLAYER1_ATTR
```

The cell instantly changes colour. No pixel drawing needed—just one byte write.

## Address Formula

For any board cell at (row, column):

```asm
address = $5800 + ((BOARD_TOP + row) × 32) + (BOARD_LEFT + column)
```

Where row and column are 0-7 within the board.

## Why Paper Colour?

We use PAPER (background) colour because:
- Screen pixels are cleared (all zeros)
- Zeros show the PAPER colour
- One attribute byte = one solid colour block

If we wanted patterns, we'd set pixels and use INK colour instead.

## Simulating a Game

The code places pieces to simulate a game in progress:

```asm
    ; Player 1 claims top-left corner
    ld hl, $5800 + (BOARD_TOP * 32) + BOARD_LEFT
    ld (hl), PLAYER1_ATTR

    ; Player 2 claims bottom-right corner
    ld hl, $5800 + ((BOARD_TOP + 7) * 32) + BOARD_LEFT + 7
    ld (hl), PLAYER2_ATTR
```

## Colour Choices

Red vs Blue works well because:
- High contrast with each other
- Both visible against white/grey
- Classic gaming rivalry
- Easy to distinguish at a glance

## The Three States

Every cell has one of three states:

| State | Colour | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Empty | White | Unclaimed territory |
| Player 1 | Red | Red's territory |
| Player 2 | Blue | Blue's territory |

## Looking Ahead

With colours working, we need:
- Input to let players choose cells
- Turn system to alternate players
- Win detection when board is full

The display is ready. Next: making it interactive.

## What You've Learnt

- **Player colours** — Attribute bytes for red, blue, and empty
- **PAPER vs INK** — Using paper colour for solid blocks
- **Cell claiming** — Writing one byte changes cell colour
- **Game state visualisation** — Colours show who controls what
