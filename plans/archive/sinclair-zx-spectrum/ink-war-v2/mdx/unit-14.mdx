## What You're Building

In Unit 12, we announced the winner over the game board. It worked, but felt rushed — the scores were still there, the board still visible. A proper results screen clears everything away and celebrates the victory.

By the end of this unit, you'll have:

- A dedicated results screen (not overlaid on gameplay)
- Final scores displayed prominently
- Win margin calculation and display
- Special handling for draws
- A polished end-of-game experience

*Title screen — play a full game to see the new results screen.*

## Results Screen Layout

The results screen needs clear hierarchy:

<CodeFromFile src="sinclair-zx-spectrum/game-01-ink-war/unit-14/snippets/01-results-constants.asm" />

The winner announcement sits at the top where eyes naturally go first. Scores come next — both players see their final territory. The win margin tells the story: was it a close battle or a decisive victory?

<InlineNote>
"Won by 6 cells" is more meaningful than just showing "35 vs 29". It tells players how close the game was.
</InlineNote>

## Separating Calculation from Display

We split winner determination into two parts: calculating the result, then displaying it:

<CodeFromFile src="sinclair-zx-spectrum/game-01-ink-war/unit-14/snippets/02-calculate-results.asm" />

The calculation determines the winner and computes the margin. The Z80's `SUB` instruction gives us the difference directly. We store both values so the display routines can use them.

## Drawing the Results Screen

The main drawing routine calls each component:

<CodeFromFile src="sinclair-zx-spectrum/game-01-ink-war/unit-14/snippets/03-draw-results.asm" />

Each element gets its own colour:
- Winner message in the player's colour (red or cyan)
- Draw message in white
- Scores in player colours
- Margin and prompt in white/yellow

## The Win Margin Message

The margin message adapts to the result:

<CodeFromFile src="sinclair-zx-spectrum/game-01-ink-war/unit-14/snippets/04-margin-message.asm" />

A win shows "WON BY X CELLS". A draw gets special treatment: "TIED AT 32 EACH!" — more interesting than just "margin = 0".

<InlineNote>
The draw message is longer, so we adjust the column position (`RESULT_MARGIN_COL - 1`) to keep it centred.
</InlineNote>

## Build It. Run It.

```bash
pasmonext --sna inkwar.asm inkwar.sna
```

Run in your emulator:

1. Press any key to start
2. Play a full game — claim all 64 cells
3. When the last cell is claimed, watch for the results screen
4. You'll see: winner announcement, final scores, and win margin
5. The border flashes in the winner's colour
6. Press any key to return to title

Try for a draw! If you can manage exactly 32 cells each, you'll see the special "TIED AT 32 EACH!" message.

## What You've Learnt

- **Dedicated screens**: Clearing away gameplay for clean presentation
- **Result calculation**: Computing winner and margin separately
- **Display hierarchy**: Most important information first
- **Special cases**: Different handling for draws
- **Polish**: Small touches that make games feel finished

## The Complete Code

<CodeFromFile src="sinclair-zx-spectrum/game-01-ink-war/unit-14/inkwar.asm" />

## Next Unit

The game is almost complete. One final touch remains: making it obvious that players can start a new game. In Unit 15, we'll add visual feedback encouraging players to press a key, ensuring no one sits at the results screen wondering what to do next.
