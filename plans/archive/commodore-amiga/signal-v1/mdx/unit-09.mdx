## What You're Building

Every arcade game needs stakes. Lives give the player a limited number of chances, and score gives them a reason to keep playing. This unit adds:

- **Lives system** starting with 3 lives
- **Score tracking** that increases when the frog advances
- **On-screen display** showing lives and score
- **Game over detection** when lives reach zero

By the end, death will actually cost something, and progress will be rewarded.

## The Lives System

Lives are simple: start with a number (traditionally 3), decrement on death, and end the game at zero.

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/01-the-lives-system.asm" lang="asm" />

When the frog dies, we decrement lives in our `kill_frog` routine:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/02-the-lives-system.asm" lang="asm" />

In `update_death`, we check if lives have run out before respawning:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/03-the-lives-system.asm" lang="asm" />

We add a new state for game over:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/04-the-lives-system.asm" lang="asm" />

## The Scoring System

Score increases when the frog makes forward progress. The simplest approach: award points whenever the frog hops upward.

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/05-the-scoring-system.asm" lang="asm" />

We use a long word (32 bits) for score because it can grow quite large. In the movement handler, we award points for upward hops:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/06-the-scoring-system.asm" lang="asm" />

## Displaying Numbers

To show lives and score on screen, we need to draw numbers. This requires:
1. A font - bitmap data for digits 0-9
2. A drawing routine to blit characters to the screen

### The Digit Font

Each digit is 8 pixels wide and 8 pixels tall - one byte per row, 8 bytes per character:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/07-displaying-numbers.asm" lang="asm" />

Each digit takes 8 bytes, so digit N starts at `font_digits + (N * 8)`.

### Drawing a Character

We use the Blitter to copy font data to the screen. Since our font is exactly 8 pixels wide (one byte), this is straightforward:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/08-displaying-numbers.asm" lang="asm" />

### Drawing Multi-Digit Numbers

Score can be several digits. We need to extract each digit and draw them left to right:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/09-displaying-numbers.asm" lang="asm" />

This approach:
1. Starts with the largest power of 10 (100000)
2. Counts how many times we can subtract it - that's our digit
3. Draws that digit
4. Moves to the next power of 10
5. Repeats for all 6 digits

### Drawing Lives

Lives are simpler - just one or two digits:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/10-displaying-numbers.asm" lang="asm" />

If you want to show lives as icons (little frogs), you could use sprites or blitter objects instead of numbers.

## Screen Layout

We need to reserve screen space for the HUD (Heads-Up Display):

```
+----------------------------------+
|  SCORE: 000000      LIVES: 3     |  <- HUD area (top 16 pixels)
+----------------------------------+
|                                  |
|           GAME AREA              |
|                                  |
+----------------------------------+
```

Adjust your zone boundaries to account for the HUD:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/11-screen-layout.asm" lang="asm" />

## Drawing Labels

We also need to draw "SCORE:" and "LIVES:" labels. We can add letter definitions to our font, or use pre-rendered bitmap labels:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/12-drawing-labels.asm" lang="asm" />

For simplicity, you could also just hard-code positions and draw the HUD once at startup rather than every frame.

## Clearing the HUD Area

Before drawing numbers, we need to clear the previous values. Use the Blitter to fill the number area with zeros:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/13-clearing-the-hud-area.asm" lang="asm" />

## Updated Main Loop

Add HUD drawing to your main loop:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/14-updated-main-loop.asm" lang="asm" />

## Game Over Handling

When `frog_state` is `STATE_GAMEOVER`, the main loop should stop normal gameplay:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/snippets/15-game-over-handling.asm" lang="asm" />

Later units will add a "GAME OVER" message and restart option.

## Build It. Run It.

Save the complete code below as `hop.asm` and build:

```bash
vasmm68k_mot -Fhunkexe -kick1hunks -nosym -o hop hop.asm
```

Create a bootable ADF:

```bash
xdftool hop.adf format "Hop" + write hop + makedir s + write s/startup-sequence "hop"
```

Run in an emulator:

```bash
fs-uae --floppy_drive_0=hop.adf
```

**Expected behaviour:**
- Score appears in top-left, starts at 000000
- Lives appear in top-right, starts at 3
- Hopping up increases score by 10
- Dying decreases lives by 1
- At 0 lives, game stops (game over state)

## What You've Learnt

| Concept | Why It Matters |
|---------|----------------|
| Lives system | Creates stakes and tension |
| Score tracking | Rewards player progress |
| Number display | Essential for any game HUD |
| Digit extraction | Divide by powers of 10 |
| HUD layout | Separate game area from info display |

## The Complete Code

Here's the full `hop.asm` with lives and scoring:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-09/hop.asm" lang="asm" />

## Recap / Sanity Check

Before moving on, verify:
- [ ] Score starts at 000000 and displays correctly
- [ ] Lives start at 3 and display correctly
- [ ] Hopping forward adds 10 to score
- [ ] Dying decrements lives by 1
- [ ] At 0 lives, game enters game over state
- [ ] HUD doesn't overlap with game area
- [ ] Code assembles without errors
