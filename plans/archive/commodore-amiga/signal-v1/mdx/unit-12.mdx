## What You're Building

Every game needs a title screen. It's the player's first impression—a chance to set the mood before gameplay begins. This unit adds:

- A game title displayed at the centre of the screen
- "PRESS FIRE TO START" prompt with blinking animation
- Clean transition from title screen to gameplay
- Game mode state machine to manage different screens

When you're done, launching the game will show the title screen. Press fire to begin playing. After game over, you'll return to the title screen to start again.

## Game Modes vs Game States

We already have game states (ALIVE, DYING, DEAD, GAMEOVER) that control what happens during gameplay. Now we need a higher-level concept: **game modes** that determine which screen we're showing.

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-12/snippets/01-game-modes-vs-game-states.asm" lang="asm" />

The game mode determines whether we run the title screen logic, the gameplay logic, or the game over screen logic. Within MODE_PLAYING, we still use our existing game states to track whether the frog is alive, dying, or dead.

This two-level approach keeps things organised:

```
Game Mode: MODE_TITLE
    └── Show title, wait for fire

Game Mode: MODE_PLAYING
    └── Game State: STATE_ALIVE (normal play)
    └── Game State: STATE_DYING (death animation)
    └── Game State: STATE_DEAD (respawn delay)
    └── (transitions to MODE_GAMEOVER when lives = 0)

Game Mode: MODE_GAMEOVER
    └── Show game over, wait for fire
    └── (transitions back to MODE_TITLE)
```

## Drawing Text to the Screen

We already have digit rendering for the score. For the title screen, we need to draw alphabetic text. We'll extend our font to include letters A-Z.

Each letter is 8x8 pixels, just like our digits. We store them as 8 bytes of bitmap data:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-12/snippets/02-drawing-text-to-the-screen.asm" lang="asm" />

For the title "HOP", we only need three letters. But let's include the full alphabet so we can display other messages too:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-12/snippets/03-drawing-text-to-the-screen.asm" lang="asm" />

## Blinking Text Effect

A static "PRESS FIRE" message is boring. Making it blink draws the player's attention and signals that input is expected.

We use a simple frame counter and toggle visibility every 30 frames (half a second at 50fps):

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-12/snippets/04-blinking-text-effect.asm" lang="asm" />

When drawing the prompt, we check `blink_visible` and skip the draw if it's zero.

## The Title Screen Loop

The title screen has its own update routine. It's simpler than gameplay—we just:

1. Update the blink timer
2. Draw the title text
3. Draw the blinking prompt (if visible)
4. Check for fire button
5. Start the game when fire is pressed

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-12/snippets/05-the-title-screen-loop.asm" lang="asm" />

## Starting a New Game

When transitioning from the title screen to gameplay, we need to reset everything:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-12/snippets/06-starting-a-new-game.asm" lang="asm" />

The `fire_delay` prevents the fire button press that started the game from immediately triggering a hop on the first frame.

## Modifying the Main Loop

Our main loop now branches based on game mode:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-12/snippets/07-modifying-the-main-loop.asm" lang="asm" />

## Text Rendering System

Let's implement the text drawing routine. It's similar to our number rendering but uses letters instead of digits:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-12/snippets/08-text-rendering-system.asm" lang="asm" />

<InlineNote>
ASCII codes make text handling straightforward. 'A' is 65, 'Z' is 90. Subtract 65 to get font indices 0-25. The same technique works for digits: '0' is 48, so subtract 48 for indices 0-9.
</InlineNote>

## The Game Over Transition

When lives reach zero during gameplay, we transition to MODE_GAMEOVER:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-12/snippets/09-the-game-over-transition.asm" lang="asm" />

## Build It. Run It.

Assemble and run:

```bash
vasmm68k_mot -Fhunkexe -o hop -nosym hop.asm
```

Run in an emulator. You should see:

1. Title screen with "HOP" displayed
2. "PRESS FIRE" blinking below
3. Press fire to start playing
4. After game over, you return to a game over screen
5. Press fire again to return to title

The game now has proper flow—title screen, gameplay, game over, and back to title.

## What You've Learnt

- **Game modes**: High-level state machine for different screens
- **Text rendering**: Drawing strings character by character
- **ASCII conversion**: Using character codes to index font data
- **Blink animation**: Frame counter toggling visibility
- **Game flow**: Clean transitions between title, play, and game over
- **Fire delay**: Preventing input from triggering across screen transitions

## The Complete Code

Here's the complete `hop.asm` with title screen support:

<CodeFromFile src="commodore-amiga/game-01-signal/unit-12/hop.asm" lang="asm" />

## Recap / Sanity Check

Before moving on, verify:

- [ ] Game starts on title screen showing "HOP"
- [ ] "PRESS FIRE" blinks on and off
- [ ] Fire button starts the game
- [ ] Game over returns to a game over screen
- [ ] Fire from game over returns to title
- [ ] Score displays correctly on game over screen
