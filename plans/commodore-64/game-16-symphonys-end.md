# Symphony's End: 256-Unit Outline

**Game:** 16 of 16
**Platform:** Commodore 64
**Units:** 256 (Capstone - maximum depth)
**Concept:** Commercial-quality showcase. A complete, polished action-adventure combining everything learnt with demo-scene visual tricks and advanced SID techniques. The curriculum ends where it began - with the SID - but now the learner commands the full machine.

---

## Why 256 Units?

Symphony's End is the capstone - the culmination of the entire C64 curriculum:
1. **Integrates ALL skills** from all 15 previous games
2. **Adds demo-scene techniques** not covered elsewhere
3. **Commercial-quality polish** throughout
4. **Advanced SID mastery** - return to where we began
5. **Professional packaging** - loader, intro, credits
6. **Extensive content** - a game worth selling

This is what learners would have created at Factor 5 or Thalamus in 1991.

### Why "Symphony's End"?
The curriculum began with SID Symphony - learning the SID chip through a rhythm game. It ends with Symphony's End - a game where the narrative involves restoring music to the world, and where the player's mastery of the SID is demonstrated through exceptional audio. The end refers both to the restoration of the symphony (story) and the completion of the learner's journey (curriculum).
