## Slogan

**Master game development through computing's golden age**

---

## Mission Statement

The 1980s gave us machines with wildly different personalities. The Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, NES, Amiga, and more all shared one truth: constraints breed creativity.

Code Like It's 198x teaches game development across these classic platforms, where counting bytes and befriending hardware aren't retro quirks but timeless skills.

Build games across every genre. Master multiple architectures. Learn to think creatively and resourcefully when the abstractions are stripped away.

---

## Core Principles

**Game-First Pedagogy:** Games teach programming. Concepts emerge from implementation, never isolated drills.

**Hardware Intimacy:** Move sprites. Read joysticks. Generate sound. Learn assembly and hardware as one.

**Original Creation:** Build games inspired by classics, not copies. No reproductions. Respect copyright.

**Mastery Through Repetition:** Build eight platformers, not one. Expertise demands volume.

**Self-Directed Learning:** Your success criterion: a playable, polished game. No instructor required.

---

## Project Scope

**Platforms:** Commodore 64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Nintendo NES, Commodore Amiga and more.

**Curriculum:** BASIC gateway to assembly mastery. Build dozens of games across multiple genres.

**Includes:** Working code, cultural history, reusable patterns, build tools.

**Excludes:** Shallow surveys, abstract theory, copyrighted reproductions.

---

## Key Features

**The Vault:** Retro computing encyclopaedia. Individuals, companies, techniques, games, events. Connects the Cold War, Berlin Wall, and cultural movements to how these machines evolved.

**Pattern Library:** Extract techniques from lessons. Adapt them to your projects. Bridge curriculum to creation.

**Professional Output:** Menus, save systems, pacing, endings. Complete games, not prototypes.

---

## Target Audience

**Entry:** No programming experience needed (BASIC gateway available).

**Core:** Aspiring developers seeking deep game fundamentals through constraints.

**Advanced:** Programmers wanting hardware mastery and optimisation skills.

**Educators:** Teaching game development, CS history, retro computing.

**Not For:** Modern engine tutorials, quick templates, shallow nostalgia.

---

## Non-Goals/Boundaries

**Not Nostalgia Tourism:** Hardware constraints teach timeless skills, not memories.

**Not Modern Engines:** No Unity, Unreal, Godot. Wrong era, wrong philosophy.

**Not Reproductions:** Build originals inspired by classics. Never copies.

**Not Quick Fixes:** Mastery takes 4-11 years. No shortcuts.

**Not Shallow Coverage:** Deep treatment per platform. No tourism.

**Not Instructor-Dependent:** Self-directed. No feedback loops.

**Not Abstract Theory:** Games teach concepts. Always.

---

## Voice & Tone Guidelines

**British English:** Colour, learnt, whilst. Exception: "program" for software.

**Playful But Rigorous:** Hardware has personality. Code must compile.

**Direct & Specific:** "POKE 53280,0" beats "change the screen."

**Era-Appropriate:** "Programme," "whilst," "learnt."

**No Marketing Speak:** No "insight blocks," "wow moments," jargon.

**Honest About Difficulty:** Assembly is hard. The reward justifies it.

---

## Success Metrics

**Working Games:** Every lesson compiles and runs.

**Student Portfolio:** 100+ complete, playable games.

**Independent Creation:** Students build beyond curriculum.

**Pattern Adoption:** Library techniques appear in student work.

**Cultural Understanding:** Students connect computing to global events.

**Self-Sufficiency:** No instructor needed. Games prove competence.

---

## Roadmap/Priorities

**Staggered Launch:** Start C64. Add platforms at intervals. Build momentum across multiple fronts.

**Early Multi-Platform Presence:** Foundation lessons across platforms quickly. Generate diverse community interest.

**Parallel - The Vault:** Grows with curriculum. Cultural context deepens across all platforms.

**Parallel - Pattern Library:** Emerges from lessons. Techniques work across architectures.

**Community-Responsive:** Deepen platforms generating strongest interest.

**Quality Maintained:** Multiple platforms, never rushed. Every lesson compiles and runs.
