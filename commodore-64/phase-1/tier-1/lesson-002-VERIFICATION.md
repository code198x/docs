# Lesson 002 Verification Checklist

## Content Complete
- [x] Learning objectives defined
- [x] Prerequisites listed
- [x] Key concepts explained (frequency tables, sequential playback, note-on/off)
- [x] Code pattern with explanation
- [x] Hardware interaction details
- [x] Common pitfalls documented
- [x] Extension ideas provided
- [x] Builds toward section
- [x] Quick reference

## Code Samples
- [x] example-1.asm created (3-note sequence)
- [x] example-1.prg compiles without errors
- [x] example-1 runs in VICE, plays C-E-G chord sequence
- [x] example-2.asm created (full C major scale)
- [x] example-2.prg compiles without errors
- [x] example-2 runs in VICE, plays 9-note scale

## Audio
- [x] example-1 audio captured (90 seconds, 44.1kHz)
- [x] example-2 audio captured (90 seconds, 44.1kHz)
- [x] Both audio files verified (RIFF WAVE format)

## Quality
- [x] British English validated
- [x] Technical terms correct
- [x] All sections present
- [x] Curriculum aligned (Arc 1: First Sound, L2 of 3)

## Integration
- [x] Files in correct locations
- [x] Referenced in Tier 1 README
- [x] Git committed with descriptive messages

## Ready for Publication: YES

## Notes
- Audio demonstrates frequency tables effectively
- Example 1: Clear C-E-G chord progression
- Example 2: Full scale shows data-driven approach
- Both use correct ACME syntax (!byte directive)
