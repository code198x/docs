# Phase 0: Commodore 64 BASIC

**Lessons:** 1-64 (4 tiers × 16 lessons)  
**Language:** Commodore BASIC V2  
**Approach:** Game-first discovery learning

## Philosophy

Learn programming by building games, not by memorizing syntax. Each short arc (2-3 lessons) produces a complete playable game. Concepts emerge naturally from trying to make games better, faster, and more interesting.

## Structure

### Tier 1: Discovery (L1-16) - Foundation Games
6 complete games introducing BASIC fundamentals and hardware basics

**Arc 1: Number Challenge (L1-3)**
- Build games with numbers, variables, and basic logic
- **Game:** Guess the Number with scoring

**Arc 2: Knowledge Base (L4-6)**
- DATA statements, arrays, string handling
- **Game:** Data-Driven Quiz Engine

**Arc 3: Visual Creation (L7-9)**
- Hardware introduction: VIC-II chip, screen memory, POKE
- **Tool:** Box Designer (PETSCII graphics)

**Arc 4: Sound Lab (L10-11)**
- SID chip basics, musical notes, sound effects
- **Tool:** Sound FX Generator

**Arc 5: Dodge & Catch (L12-14)**
- Keyboard control, collision detection, game loop
- **Game:** Star Catcher (complete action game)

**Arc 6: Mini Adventure (L15-16)**
- Timers, state management, text adventure
- **Game:** Crystal Caverns (synthesis game, ~60 lines)

### Tier 2: Building (L17-32) - Technical Depth
4 complete games mastering sprites, sound, and physics (see tier-2/README.md)

### Tier 3: Mastery (L33-48) - Professional Games
3 complete professional-quality games (see tier-3/README.md)

### Tier 4: Limits (L49-64) - BASIC's Ceiling
3 games that explicitly demonstrate BASIC's performance limits (see tier-4/README.md)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of Phase 0, you will have:
- Built **16 complete games** ranging from 5-60 lines initially to 200+ lines
- Mastered all BASIC V2 fundamentals
- Understood C64 hardware architecture (VIC-II, SID, CIA)
- Experienced BASIC's performance ceiling
- Developed the foundation for Phase 1 (Assembly language)

## Prerequisites

None. This is the starting point for the entire curriculum.

## Next Phase

**Phase 1: Assembly Language + Hardware Fundamentals**  
Build 16 classic arcade games (Pong → Centipede) while learning 6510 assembly from scratch.
