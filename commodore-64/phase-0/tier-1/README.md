# Tier 1: Discovery (Lessons 1-16)

**Philosophy:** Foundation games with immediate wins
**Arc Length:** Short (2-3 lessons)
**Games Built:** 6 complete games
**Code Range:** 5-60 lines
**Hardware Introduced:** VIC-II, SID, CIA basics

## Goals

- Learn by building games, not memorizing syntax
- Each arc produces a complete playable game in 2-3 lessons
- Discover programming concepts naturally through gameplay needs
- First exposure to C64 hardware (colours, sound, screen memory)
- Build confidence with rapid progression and immediate results

## Arcs Overview

### Arc 1: Number Challenge (L1-3)
**Game:** Guess the Number with scoring
**Concepts:** Variables, input, conditionals, loops, random numbers

- **L1:** Hello, Computer - Infinite counter
- **L2:** Maths Master - Calculator quiz
- **L3:** Guess the Number - Complete guessing game with scoring

### Arc 2: Knowledge Base (L4-6)
**Game:** Data-Driven Quiz Engine
**Concepts:** DATA statements, arrays, string handling, READ

- **L4:** Quiz Master - Simple quiz
- **L5:** High Score Hall - Top 5 leaderboard with sorting
- **L6:** Data-Driven Quiz - Expandable quiz engine using DATA

### Arc 3: Visual Creation (L7-9)
**Tool:** Box Designer (PETSCII graphics)
**Concepts:** Hardware introduction, VIC-II chip, screen memory, POKE, GET
**Hardware:** First direct hardware access!

- **L7:** Rainbow Border - Animated colour cycling (first hardware touch!)
- **L8:** Screen Painter - Draw patterns on screen memory
- **L9:** Box Designer - Interactive PETSCII graphics tool

### Arc 4: Sound Lab (L10-11)
**Tool:** Sound FX Generator
**Concepts:** SID chip basics, musical notes, sound effects, POKE for sound
**Hardware:** Introduction to the legendary SID chip

- **L10:** Beep Composer - Play musical notes on SID
- **L11:** Sound FX Generator - 4-5 game sound effects library

### Arc 5: Dodge & Catch (L12-14)
**Game:** Star Catcher (complete action game)
**Concepts:** Keyboard control, collision detection, game loop, timing

- **L12:** Character Mover - WASD keyboard control
- **L13:** Falling Stars - Add random falling objects
- **L14:** Star Catcher - Complete game with collision, score, lives

### Arc 6: Mini Adventure (L15-16)
**Game:** Crystal Caverns (synthesis game, ~60 lines)
**Concepts:** Timers, state management, text adventure structure
**Hardware:** CIA timer (TI variable)

- **L15:** Countdown Timer - Time-based challenges using TI
- **L16:** **SYNTHESIS** - Crystal Caverns (complete text adventure, ~60 lines)

## Learning Outcomes

By completing Tier 1, you will have:

- Built **6 complete games** from scratch
- Mastered all BASIC V2 fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals, arrays, DATA)
- Directly controlled C64 hardware (VIC-II for graphics, SID for sound, CIA for timing)
- Written programs ranging from 5 to 60 lines
- Understood the game development loop (input → process → output → repeat)
- Gained confidence in hardware programming through POKE commands

## Prerequisites

None. This is the starting point for the entire curriculum.

## Builds Toward

**Tier 2:** Building (L17-32) - Sprite mastery, advanced sound, physics simulation
**Next Concepts:** Sprites, joystick control, multi-voice music, smooth movement

## Key Discovery Moments

Throughout Tier 1, you'll experience several "wow" realizations:

1. **L1-3:** "I can make the computer interactive!"
2. **L7:** "I can directly touch the hardware - this is powerful!"
3. **L8-9:** "Screen memory is just numbers I can manipulate directly"
4. **L10-11:** "I can create any sound I want with just POKE commands"
5. **L14:** "I built a complete action game in BASIC!"
6. **L16:** "I can combine everything into something genuinely fun"

## Teaching Notes

**Arc Structure:**
- **Lesson 1 of arc:** Simple demonstration of new concept
- **Lesson 2 of arc:** Build on concept with more complexity
- **Lesson 3 of arc:** Synthesize into complete game

**Progression Pattern:**
- Start with pure BASIC (L1-6)
- Introduce hardware gradually (L7: colours, L8-9: screen memory, L10-11: sound)
- Combine concepts in increasingly sophisticated ways (L12-14: game loop)
- Synthesize everything learned (L16: text adventure using all skills)

**Important:** Speed/performance is NOT a concern in Tier 1. Focus on concepts and building confidence. Performance awareness begins naturally in Tier 2 when students try to build faster-paced games with sprites.
