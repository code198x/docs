## Why This Matters

Getting stuck in games was a real problem:
1. **No internet** - Couldn't just look it up
2. **Paid services** - Hint lines cost money
3. **Physical media** - Guides were books
4. **Community knowledge** - Playground tips
5. **Magazine dependency** - Tips sections valuable

This shaped how games were designed and played.
