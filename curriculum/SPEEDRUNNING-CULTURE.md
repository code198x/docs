## Why Speedrunning Matters

Speedrunning demonstrates:
1. **Deep game mastery** - Understanding systems completely
2. **Community collaboration** - Shared knowledge and discovery
3. **Preservation** - Keeping old games relevant
4. **Technical analysis** - Reverse engineering games
5. **Entertainment** - Millions watch speedruns

## Part 1: Origins

### Score Competition Era

Before speedrunning, there was score chasing:

| Era | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| **Arcade** | High scores, initials |
| **Home** | Magazine score tables |
| **Twin Galaxies** | Official record keeping |

**Twin Galaxies** (1981) tracked arcade high scores.

### Early Speed Competition

| Game | Era | Competition |
|------|-----|-------------|
| **Dragster (2600)** | 1982 | Fastest time |
| **Super Mario Bros.** | 1985+ | Fastest completion |
| **Metroid** | 1986 | Time-based endings |

Some games had built-in time tracking (Metroid showed play time).

### Doom and Quake Demos

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| **Demo recording** | Built into engines |
| **Compet-N** | Doom speedrun archive (1994) |
| **Quake Done Quick** | Famous speedrun movie (1997) |

id Software's demo system enabled speedrun recording and sharing.

**Quake Done Quick** (1997) was a collaborative speedrun that inspired many.

## Part 2: Speedrun Categories

### Common Categories

| Category | Rules |
|----------|-------|
| **Any%** | Complete game by any means |
| **100%** | Complete everything |
| **Glitchless** | No exploits |
| **Low%** | Minimum items/completion |
| **All Bosses** | Defeat every boss |

### Platform-Specific Categories

| Game | Unique Categories |
|------|-------------------|
| **Super Mario 64** | 0 Star, 16 Star, 70 Star, 120 Star |
| **Ocarina of Time** | All Dungeons, MST, any% |
| **Pokemon** | Catch 'em All, specific Pokemon |

### Category Evolution

Categories emerge from community consensus:
1. Someone does something unusual
2. Others attempt to beat it
3. Rules get formalised
4. Leaderboards track times
