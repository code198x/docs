# Gaming Subcultures: The Underground That Shaped the Industry

**Purpose:** Document the interconnected subcultures of the demo scene, cracking/piracy, trainers, and LAN parties - and how they influenced mainstream gaming.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-18

---

## Why This Matters

These subcultures:
1. **Trained generations of developers** - Demo coders became industry programmers
2. **Pushed hardware limits** - Techniques discovered by sceners entered games
3. **Created communities** - Before the internet, these were the networks
4. **Influenced aesthetics** - Demo visuals shaped game graphics
5. **Built tools** - Crackers created development tools everyone used

The line between "scene" and "industry" was often nonexistent.

## Part 1: The Cracking Scene

### Origins

Software piracy existed from day one, but the **cracking scene** turned it into a culture:

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| **1979-82** | Early Apple II cracks, simple distribution |
| **1982-85** | C64 scene emerges, first crack intros |
| **1985-89** | Golden age - elaborate intros, group competition |
| **1989-95** | Amiga/PC era, scene formalises |

### How It Worked

1. **Release group** obtains game (store theft, insider, mail trade)
2. **Cracker** removes copy protection
3. **Intro coder** adds group's intro screen
4. **Supplier** distributes via BBS or mail trade
5. **Couriers** spread to other BBSs/groups

### Copy Protection vs Crackers

| Protection | Technique | Cracker Response |
|------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Lenslok** | Physical prism device | Bypass in software |
| **Speedlock** | Non-standard tape timing | Custom loaders |
| **Code wheels** | Manual lookup required | Crack or include answers |
| **Disk checks** | Bad sectors, timing | Sector copy tools |
| **Dongles** | Hardware keys | Emulate in software |

This cat-and-mouse game trained excellent reverse engineers.

### Crack Intros: Birth of the Demo

**Crack intros** started as simple "Cracked by X" screens but evolved:

| Evolution | Features |
|-----------|----------|
| **1983-84** | Text credit, maybe colour cycling |
| **1985-86** | Scrolling text, simple music |
| **1986-88** | Raster effects, sprite animations |
| **1988-90** | Full demos as intros, competition for best |

The intros became **more interesting than many games**. Groups competed on intro quality, not just crack speed.

This directly spawned the demo scene - same skills, legal outlet.

**Vault entry:**
- `crack-intros` - Culture/technique entry

## Part 2: The Demo Scene

### What Is a Demo?

A **demo** is a real-time audiovisual presentation showcasing:
- Programming skill (effects, optimisation)
- Graphics (pixel art, 3D)
- Music (chiptune, tracked)
- Design (flow, aesthetic)

Demos are **non-interactive** - they run and you watch. The art is in the code.

## Part 3: Trainers

### What Is a Trainer?

A **trainer** modifies a game in memory to enable cheats:
- Infinite lives
- Infinite ammo
- Invincibility
- Level skip
- Freeze enemies

### Evolution

| Era | Method |
|-----|--------|
| **1980s** | POKE commands (Spectrum), memory editors |
| **1990s** | Standalone trainer programs |
| **2000s** | Integrated cheat engines |
| **Modern** | Cheat Engine, trainers, mods |

### Spectrum POKEs

The Spectrum had a unique culture of **POKEs** - memory modifications:

```
POKE 23456, 0   ; Infinite lives
```

Magazines published POKE lists. Players typed them in before loading games.

**Why this matters:**
- Taught memory architecture
- Introduced reverse engineering
- Created tool culture
- "Multiface" hardware - freeze and modify

### Trainer Groups

Trainers were often made by crack groups as value-add:

| Group | Era | Notes |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Fairlight** | 1980s+ | Included trainers with cracks |
| **Skid Row** | 1990s | "+5 trainer" culture |
| **PARADOX** | 1990s+ | Quality trainers |

**Vault entries:**
- `trainers` - Culture/technique entry
- `poke-codes` - Culture entry (Spectrum-specific)
- `multiface` - Hardware entry
- `cheat-codes` - Culture entry (differs from trainers)

### Trainers → Game Development

Understanding trainers teaches:
- Memory layout
- How games store data
- Reverse engineering
- Debugging techniques

Many developers learned by hacking games before making them.

## Part 4: LAN Parties

### Origins

Before widespread internet, **LAN parties** connected computers locally:

| Era | Characteristics |
|-----|-----------------|
| **1980s** | BBS meetups, small gatherings |
| **1990-95** | Doom/Quake drove growth |
| **1995-2005** | Golden age, massive events |
| **2005+** | Internet reduced need, events became festivals |

### Why LAN Parties Existed

## Part 5: BBS Culture

### The Pre-Internet Network

**Bulletin Board Systems** connected the scenes:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **File distribution** | Warez, demos, tools |
| **Communication** | Message boards, email |
| **Community** | Local and long-distance |
| **Gaming** | Door games (TradeWars, L.O.R.D.) |

### Types of BBSs

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Warez boards** | Pirated software |
| **Demo boards** | Scene releases |
| **Game boards** | Door games, trading |
| **General** | Local community |
| **Elite** | Invite-only, first releases |

### BBS Software

| **WWIV** | PC | Popular in USA |
| **RemoteAccess** | PC | European favourite |
| **Maximus** | PC | OS/2 and DOS |
| **C*Base** | C64 | 8-bit BBSs existed! |

### BBS → Internet

BBSs died as internet access spread (1995-2000), but the culture transferred:
- IRC channels replaced message boards
- FTP sites replaced file areas
- Websites replaced BBSs
- But the community structures persisted

## Part 6: The Interconnections

### How It All Links Together

```
Copy Protection
      ↓
Crackers (to defeat it)
      ↓
Crack Intros (to show off)
      ↓
Demo Scene (legal outlet)
      ↓
Demo Parties (community events)
      ↓

```

### The Same People

Often the same individuals participated in multiple scenes:
- Cracker by day, demo coder by night
- Trainer maker who became game developer
- BBS sysop who organised LAN parties
- Demo musician who composed game soundtracks

### Skills Learned

| Activity | Skills Gained |
|----------|---------------|
| **Cracking** | Reverse engineering, assembly, persistence |
| **Demo coding** | Graphics, optimisation, real-time systems |
| **Trainer making** | Memory architecture, debugging |
| **BBS running** | Networking, community management |
| **LAN organising** | Event management, tech support |

## Part 7: Legal and Ethical Notes

### For the Curriculum

We document this history because:
1. It happened and shaped the industry
2. Many respected developers came from these scenes
3. The technical skills are valuable
4. Understanding history provides context

We're **not** endorsing piracy. The demo scene evolved **away** from piracy into legitimate digital art.

### The Scene's Own Ethics

The scene had internal ethics:
- Don't crack games you could buy
- Credit original creators
- Don't profit (no selling cracks)
- Competition on skill, not theft

Many sceners became vocal **anti-piracy** advocates once they made games professionally.

## Part 8: Size Coding & Code Golf

### The Origins of Code Golf

**Code golf** - writing the smallest possible program to achieve a task - has direct roots in demo scene size competitions and 8-bit memory constraints.

### The Progression

| Era | Constraint | Culture |
|-----|------------|---------|
| **1980s** | 48KB RAM, 170KB disks | "Fit the game on one tape/disk" |
| **Late 1980s** | Crack intro size limits | Impressive effects in tiny space |
| **1990s** | Demo categories (64K, 4K) | Formalised size competitions |
| **2000s** | 256 byte, 128 byte, 64 byte | Extreme size coding |
| **Modern** | Code golf sites, JS1K, Shadertoy | Recreational size coding |

### Demo Scene Size Categories

| Category | Size | Challenge |
|----------|------|-----------|
| **Demo** | Unlimited | Full artistic expression |
| **64K intro** | 65,536 bytes | Procedural generation required |
| **4K intro** | 4,096 bytes | Extreme compression, every byte matters |
| **1K intro** | 1,024 bytes | Barely possible, minimalist |
| **256 byte** | 256 bytes | Pure assembly wizardry |
| **128 byte** | 128 bytes | Near-impossible constraints |
| **64 byte** | 64 bytes | Single effect, maximum density |

### Legendary Size-Coded Productions

| Production | Size | Achievement |
|------------|------|-------------|
| **fr-08: .the" product** | 64K | Full 3D engine, procedural textures, music |
| **.kkrieger** | 96K | Complete FPS game with levels |
| **Elevated** | 4K | Entire mountain landscape with flythrough |
| **Memories** | 256 bytes | C64 demo, multiple effects |
| **Tube** | 256 bytes | Full 3D tunnel on C64 |

### Techniques Born from Size Constraints

| Technique | Purpose | Modern Use |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **Procedural generation** | Create content algorithmically | Every modern game |
| **Compressed bytecode** | Pack logic tightly | Game scripting |
| **Procedural textures** | Generate instead of store | Texture synthesis |
| **Procedural music** | Algorithmic composition | Generative audio |
| **Shader tricks** | Math over data | GPU programming |
| **Self-extracting code** | Compressed executable | Installers, packers |

### Code Golf Evolution

#### 8-bit Era (Implicit Code Golf)

Every byte mattered:
- C64: 64KB total, 38KB usable with BASIC
- Spectrum: 48KB, screen takes 6.75KB
- Fitting a game on 170KB disk = constant optimisation

Programmers competed informally on who could fit more features.

#### Demo Scene (Formalised)

Size categories created explicit competition:
- 64K intros forced procedural generation
- 4K intros pushed mathematical elegance
- 256-byte challenged what's possible

#### Modern Code Golf (Recreational)

| Community | Focus |
|-----------|-------|
| **code.golf** | Shortest solutions in various languages |
| **JS1K** | JavaScript in 1024 bytes |
| **Shadertoy** | Size-constrained shaders |
| **PICO-8** | 8KB cart limit |
| **TIC-80** | Similar constraints |
| **dwitter.net** | 140 character JavaScript |
| **Pouet.net** | Demo scene database, size coding |

### Key People in Size Coding

| Person | Handle | Known For |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Gábor Lázár** | Sensible | 256-byte demos |
| **Linus Åkesson** | lft | C64 extreme size coding |
| **Iñigo Quilez** | iq | Shadertoy founder, procedural pioneer |
| **Fabian Giesen** | ryg | Farbrausch, compression genius |
| **Tom Thumb** | Various | 256-byte specialists |

### Why Size Coding Matters

| Skill | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| **Deep hardware understanding** | Embedded systems, drivers |
| **Algorithmic thinking** | Efficient code everywhere |
| **Compression expertise** | Data engineering |
| **Mathematical elegance** | Shader programming |
| **Resource awareness** | Mobile, web, constrained platforms |
| **Creative problem solving** | Universal |

### Connection to Curriculum

Our curriculum teaches **constraint-based thinking**:
- 64KB C64 programs
- 48KB Spectrum games
- NES cartridge limits
- Every platform has constraints

This is the same discipline that created:
- Demo scene size coding
- Modern code golf
- Efficient game engines
- Procedural generation
