## Why Licensed Games Matter

Licensed games were:

## Part 1: The Business Model

### Why Licensed Games Existed

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Marketing** | Film/TV marketing sold the game |
| **Recognition** | Parents bought known brands |
| **Shelf space** | Retailers favoured known properties |
| **Deadlines** | Movie release = hard deadline |
| **Risk reduction** | Publishers avoided unknown IPs |

### The Typical Deal

| Party | Role |
|-------|------|
| **License holder** | Film studio, TV network, toy company |
| **Publisher** | Paid license fee, handled distribution |
| **Developer** | Made the game (often underpaid) |
| **Retailer** | Stocked based on license, not quality |

### The Deadline Problem

Movie tie-ins had immovable deadlines:
- Game must ship with film release
- Development often started late (script changes)
- Crunch was endemic
- Quality suffered
