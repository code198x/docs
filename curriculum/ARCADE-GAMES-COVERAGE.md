## Why Arcades Matter

Nearly every genre we teach originated in arcades:
- **Shooters** → Space Invaders, Galaga, Defender
- **Platformers** → Donkey Kong, Mario Bros
- **Maze games** → Pac-Man
- **Racing** → Pole Position, OutRun
- **Beat 'em ups** → Double Dragon, Final Fight
- **Fighting games** → Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat

Home games were often ports, clones, or spiritual successors. Understanding arcades means understanding the source.

## Part 1: The Arcade Business Model

### Design Philosophy: Coin Drop

Arcade games were designed to:

| Goal | Design Impact |
|------|---------------|
| **Attract players** | Flashy attract modes, distinctive sounds |
| **Teach quickly** | Learn in seconds, master over hours |
| **Extract coins** | Difficulty curves that kill you fairly |
| **Encourage replay** | "Just one more go" feeling |
| **Rotate players** | Average 3 minutes per credit |

This created design principles still used today:
- **Instant accessibility** - No manuals, no tutorials
- **Escalating difficulty** - Easy start, increasing challenge
- **Fair death** - Player should know why they died
- **High scores** - Competition drives replay
- **Attract mode** - Game sells itself

## Curriculum Integration

### Already Referenced

Many curriculum games reference arcade origins:
- Game 1 (Shooters) → Galaga, Phoenix
- Game 3 (Maze) → Pac-Man
- Game 10 (Racing) → OutRun
- Game 12 (Fighting) → Street Fighter II
- Game 13 (Shmup) → R-Type, Gradius

### Design Principles from Arcades

Every curriculum game should teach:
- **Instant accessibility** - Playable in seconds
- **Attract mode** - Show the game off
- **Fair difficulty** - Challenge without frustration
- **Score chasing** - Replay value

### Vault Integration

Arcade entries provide context:
> "The wave patterns we're implementing mirror [Galaga](/vault/games/galaga)'s formation attacks."

> "Our difficulty curve follows the [coin-drop philosophy](/vault/culture/coin-drop-philosophy) - challenging but fair."
