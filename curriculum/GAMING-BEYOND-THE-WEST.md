# Gaming Beyond the West: Iron Curtain & Non-Traditional Territories

**Purpose:** Document parallel gaming evolution in Soviet bloc, South America, Asia (outside Japan), and other regions often overlooked.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-18

---

## Why This Matters

The story of gaming is usually told as USA/Japan/UK. But parallel evolution happened worldwide:
- Engineers reverse-engineered Western hardware
- Original designs emerged from necessity
- Unique gaming cultures developed
- Some innovations predated or paralleled Western work

Understanding this provides:
1. **Historical completeness** - Gaming wasn't just the West
2. **Engineering appreciation** - Building without resources
3. **Cultural context** - Different games for different societies
4. **Fascinating stories** - Often more interesting than mainstream history

## Part 1: Soviet Bloc Computing

### The Spectrum Clones

The ZX Spectrum was cheap and simple enough to clone. Hundreds of variants emerged:

| Clone | Country | Era | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----|-------|
| **Pentagon** | USSR | 1989+ | Enhanced Spectrum, 1MB RAM possible |
| **Scorpion** | USSR/Russia | 1990s | Professional quality, still made |
| **Didaktik** | Czechoslovakia | 1987+ | Official school computer |
| **Hobbit** | USSR | 1990s | Russian Spectrum variant |
| **Elwro 800 Junior** | Poland | 1986 | Polish educational computer |
| **HC-85, HC-90** | Romania | 1985+ | Romanian clones |
| **Pravetz 8D** | Bulgaria | 1985 | Bulgarian educational computer |

**Why Spectrum?** Simple architecture, available documentation, educational mandate to teach computing. The USSR needed computers; the Spectrum was copyable.

### Original Soviet Designs

Not everything was a clone:

| Computer | Country | Era | Notes |
|----------|---------|-----|-------|
| **Agat** | USSR | 1984 | Apple II-inspired but original design |
