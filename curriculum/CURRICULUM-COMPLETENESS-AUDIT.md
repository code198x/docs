## Gaps Identified

### 1. Game Design Fundamentals

We teach *how* to program games, but less on *why* design decisions work.

| Topic | Importance | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| **Level design principles** | High | Pacing, flow, teaching through play |
| **Difficulty curves** | High | Balancing challenge and frustration |
| **Player psychology** | Medium | Reward loops, motivation |
| **Tutorialisation** | High | Teaching without tutorials (Miyamoto's approach) |
| **Feedback loops** | High | Risk/reward, progression |
| **Pacing** | High | Tension and release |
| **"Game feel" / "Juice"** | High | What makes controls satisfying |

**Vault entries needed:**
- `game-feel` - Technique entry
- `difficulty-curve` - Technique entry
- `tutorialisation` - Technique entry (Miyamoto's World 1-1 approach)
- `super-mario-bros-1-1` - The most analysed level in gaming

**Key people:**
- `shigeru-miyamoto` - Already listed, but emphasis on design philosophy
- `sid-meier` - "Interesting decisions" philosophy
- `will-wright` - Systems thinking, player creativity
- `mark-cerny` - "Cerny Method" of game design
