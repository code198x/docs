**Purpose:** Map all potential target platforms and their appropriate coverage level - from full curriculum to Vault-only entries.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-18

---

## Coverage Tiers

| Tier | Description | Content |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Tier 1: Full Curriculum** | Complete game sequences, 16 games | Current: C64, Spectrum, Amiga, NES |
| **Tier 2: Substantial** | 8 games, focused curriculum | High-value platforms worth deep coverage |
| **Tier 3: Introductory** | 4 games, core concepts | Interesting platforms, lighter treatment |
| **Tier 4: Reference** | Documentation, no games | Historical context, Vault entries, comparisons |
| **Tier 5: Vault Only** | Entries for context | Mentioned in relation to other platforms |

---

## Part 1: Current Tier 1 Platforms

### Confirmed Full Curriculum (16 games each)

| Platform | CPU | Status | Notes |
|----------|-----|--------|-------|
| **Commodore 64** | 6502 | Active | Flagship platform |
| **ZX Spectrum** | Z80 | Planned | UK essential |
| **Commodore Amiga** | 68000 | Planned | 16-bit flagship |
| **NES** | 6502 | Planned | Console essential |

### Potential Tier 1 Additions

| Platform | CPU | Case For | Case Against |
|----------|-----|----------|--------------|
| **BBC Micro** | 6502 | Educational heritage, excellent BASIC | Smaller global audience |
| **Mega Drive/Genesis** | 68000 | Huge library, well documented | Similar to Amiga (68000) |

---

## Part 2: Tier 2 Candidates (8 games)

### Strong Candidates

| Platform | CPU | Unique Value | Audience |
|----------|-----|--------------|----------|
| **Game Boy** | Z80-like | Handheld constraints, active homebrew, GB Studio | Large, nostalgia + active |
| **MSX** | Z80 | Japanese gaming, standardisation story | Japan, Europe, Brazil |
| **Atari 8-bit** | 6502 | ANTIC/GTIA, display lists, predates C64 | US, retro enthusiasts |
| **Amstrad CPC** | Z80 | Gate array, UK/Spain/France | UK, Spain, France |

### Coverage Approach for Tier 2

- 8 games instead of 16
- Focus on platform-specific techniques
- Cross-reference to Tier 1 platforms
- "If you learned X on C64, here's how it differs"

---

## Part 3: Tier 3 Candidates (4 games)

### Introductory Coverage

| **TRS-80** | Z80 | Early home computer | Limited graphics |
| **Acorn Electron** | 6502 | Budget BBC | Subset of BBC Micro |
| **Vic-20** | 6502 | Pre-C64, constraints | Superseded by C64 |
| **Neo Geo** | 68000 | Arcade power at home | Expensive, niche |
| **PC Engine/TurboGrafx** | 6502 | HuCard magic, CD-ROM | Smaller Western audience |
| **Atari Jaguar** | 68000 + RISC | "Do the math", failure study | Historical curiosity |
| **3DO** | ARM | CD-ROM era | Trip Hawkins connection |
| **Atari Lynx** | 6502 | Colour handheld, Epyx connection | Commercial failure |
| **Sega Game Gear** | Z80 | Master System portable | Battery life issues |

### Coverage Approach for Tier 3

- 4 games covering core concepts
- Focus on what makes platform unique
- Historical context heavy
- "Here's what this platform taught us"

---

## Part 4: Tier 4 - Reference Only

| Platform | CPU | Why Reference Only |
|----------|-----|--------------------|
| **Colecovision** | Z80 | Similar to MSX/Spectrum |
| **Intellivision** | CP1610 | Unusual architecture, limited appeal |
| **Vectrex** | 6809 | Vector graphics - fascinating but niche |
| **Odyssey 2** | 8048 | Very limited |
| **Fairchild Channel F** | F8 | Historical first, limited capability |
| **Bally Astrocade** | Z80 | Interesting, very niche |
| **Thomson TO7/MO5** | 6809 | French schools, limited outside France |
| **Microbee** | Z80 | Australian schools |
| **Oric** | 6502 | French market |
| **Dragon 32/64** | 6809 | UK, limited library |
| **SAM Coupé** | Z80 | Spectrum successor, came too late |
| **Enterprise 128** | Z80 | Hungarian, interesting but obscure |

### Reference Documentation Includes

- Hardware specifications
- Historical context
