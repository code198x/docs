## Why Game Music Matters

Game music is:
1. **Technical achievement** - Creating music within constraints
2. **Cultural phenomenon** - Iconic melodies known worldwide
3. **Art form** - Composers as artists
4. **Living tradition** - Chiptune scene continues
5. **Preservation challenge** - Music tied to hardware

## Part 1: Hardware Constraints

### Sound Chips by Platform

| Platform | Chip | Channels | Notes |
|----------|------|----------|-------|
| **Atari 2600** | TIA | 2 | Very limited |
| **C64** | SID 6581/8580 | 3 | Filters, ADSR |
| **Spectrum** | Beeper | 1 (bit) | Software tricks |
| **Spectrum 128** | AY-3-8910 | 3 | Square waves |
| **NES** | 2A03 | 5 | Pulse, triangle, noise, DMC |
| **Master System** | SN76489 | 4 | Similar to ColecoVision |
| **Amiga** | Paula | 4 | 8-bit samples |
| **Mega Drive** | YM2612 + SN76489 | 10 | FM synthesis |
| **SNES** | SPC700 | 8 | 16-bit samples, DSP |

### The SID Chip

| Aspect | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Designer** | Bob Yannes |
| **Channels** | 3 voices |
| **Waveforms** | Triangle, sawtooth, pulse, noise |
| **Features** | Ring mod, sync, filters |
| **Legacy** | Most expressive 8-bit chip |

The SID enabled music impossible on other 8-bit systems.

**6581 vs 8580:** Different filter characteristics, musicians had preferences.

### The AY-3-8910

| Platform | Usage |
|----------|-------|
| **Spectrum 128** | Standard sound |
| **Amstrad CPC** | Standard sound |
| **Atari ST** | YM2149 variant |
| **MSX** | Standard sound |

Three square wave channels plus noise - simpler than SID but ubiquitous.

### FM Synthesis

| Chip | Platform | Channels |
|------|----------|----------|
| **YM2612** | Mega Drive | 6 FM |
| **YM2151** | Arcade | 8 FM |
| **YM2413** | MSX2+, SMS (Japan) | 9 FM |

FM synthesis produced distinctive sounds - Mega Drive had a unique character.
