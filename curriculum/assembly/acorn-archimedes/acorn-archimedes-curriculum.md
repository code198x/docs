# Acorn Archimedes Assembly Curriculum

**Status:** Future — Stub Entry
**Priority:** Medium
**CPU:** ARM2/ARM3

---

## Why This Platform?

- First ARM platform — historically significant
- ARM architecture dominates modern devices
- BBC BASIC V provides exceptional gateway track
- Powerful for its era (1987)
- Teaches RISC concepts vs CISC (6502, Z80, 68000)

## Hardware Overview

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| CPU | ARM2 @ 8 MHz (later ARM3 @ 25 MHz) |
| Graphics | VIDC (256 colours from 4096) |
| Sound | VIDC (8 channels, 8-bit stereo) |
| RAM | 512 KB - 16 MB |
| Resolution | Up to 1152×896 (mono) |
| OS | RISC OS |

## Key Features

- **RISC architecture:** Fixed-length instructions, load/store model
- **Barrel shifter:** Powerful operand manipulation
- **Conditional execution:** Every instruction can be conditional
- **BBC BASIC V:** Fast, integrated assembler
- **RISC OS:** Cooperative multitasking, modular

## Curriculum Approach (Proposed)

**Track:** Assembly (ARM)
**Games:** 4-8 (Tier 2-3 platform)
**Units per game:** 8, 16, or 32

Would teach ARM fundamentals:
- RISC concepts and pipeline
- ARM instruction set
- Conditional execution
- Barrel shifter tricks
- SWI (software interrupts) for OS calls
- VIDC programming

## Toolchain

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| BBC BASIC V | Built-in assembler |
| asasm | Command-line ARM assembler |
| AASM | Alternative assembler |
| Arculator | Accurate emulator |
| RPCEmu | RISC OS emulator |

## Historical Significance

- ARM2 was first commercial ARM chip
- ARM now powers most smartphones
- Understanding ARM roots provides modern relevance
- RISC OS still actively developed
