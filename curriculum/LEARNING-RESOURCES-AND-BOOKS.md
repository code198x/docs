# Learning Resources: Books, Part Works & Educational Media

**Purpose:** Document the books, part works, and educational resources that taught a generation to program - the true origin point for many developers.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-18

## Why This Matters

For many programmers, their journey began not with a magazine or a game, but with a **book**. These resources:

1. **Created programmers** - First exposure to coding for millions
2. **Democratised knowledge** - Available in libraries, affordable
3. **Structured learning** - Progressive skill building
4. **Platform agnostic** (sometimes) - Concepts over syntax
5. **Survived the machines** - Still readable today

The Usborne books alone likely created more programmers than any computer science course.

## Part 1: Usborne Computing Books

### The Usborne Revolution

| Aspect | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Publisher** | Usborne Publishing (UK) |
| **Era** | 1982-1986 primarily |
| **Audience** | Children and beginners |
| **Approach** | Colourful, illustrated, accessible |
| **Languages** | BASIC (multi-dialect), some machine code |
| **Legacy** | Taught millions to program |

### Why Usborne Worked

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Illustrations** | Made code approachable |
| **Colour coding** | Syntax highlighting before IDEs |
| **Worked examples** | Type-in programs that did things |
| **Cross-platform** | Conversion tables for different BASICs |
| **Library availability** | Free access for anyone |
| **Child-friendly** | Not intimidating |

### Key Usborne Titles

#### Programming & Coding

| Title | Year | Focus |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Introduction to Computer Programming** | 1982 | BASIC fundamentals |
| **Computer Programming: BASIC** | 1983 | Deeper BASIC |

20 DIM W$(10)
30 PRINT "THINK OF A WORD"
...
```

This simple game taught:
- String manipulation
- Arrays
- Loops
- Conditional logic
- User input
- Game state

**For many (including the curriculum creator), this was the beginning of everything.**

- Local variables
- Built-in assembler
- Clear syntax

### The TV Series

| Series | Year | Presenter |
|--------|------|-----------|
| **The Computer Programme** | 1982 | Chris Serle, Ian McNaught-Davis |
| **Making the Most of the Micro** | 1983 | Same presenters |
| **Micro Live** | 1984-1987 | Various |

| **GRASS** | Geography | Map-based learning |

**Granny's Garden** terrified and educated a generation.

### Other Countries' School Initiatives

| Country | Initiative | Computer |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **UK** | BBC Computer Literacy Project | BBC Micro |
| **France** | Plan Informatique pour Tous | Thomson TO7/MO5 |
| **Australia** | Various state programs | Microbee, Apple II |

| **Dominance** | De facto US educational standard |
| **Software** | Oregon Trail, Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? |
| **Logo** | Turtle graphics popular |
| **No central plan** | School districts chose independently |

**Oregon Trail** (1974, many versions) taught American children about history (and dysentery).

### Long-Term Impact

| Effect | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| **UK games industry** | Many developers started on BBC Micro at school |
| **Computer science education** | Curriculum established |
| **Gender representation** | Early computing was more gender-balanced |
| **Digital literacy** | Foundation for later internet age |

### The Generation Effect

Children who used computers at school in 1982-1990:
- Born roughly 1970-1982
- Working age by 1990s-2000s
- Founded or staffed tech companies
- Taught the next generation

**The UK games industry's strength in the 1990s-2000s traces directly to school computing in the 1980s.**

### Modern Parallels

| 1980s | Modern |
|-------|--------|
| BBC Micro | Raspberry Pi (intentional callback) |
| BBC BASIC | Scratch, Python |
| Computer Literacy Project | Computing curriculum |
| Teacher training | CPD programs |
| Classroom computers | 1:1 devices |

**Raspberry Pi** explicitly aims to recreate the BBC Micro experience - affordable, programmable, educational.

## Part 11: Curriculum Connection

### Why This History Matters

Our curriculum recreates this journey:
- Start simple (like BASIC type-ins)
- Build progressively (like part works)
- Learn through making games (like Usborne)
- Master low-level eventually (like machine code books)

### The Usborne Spirit

Our approach channels Usborne:
- Colourful and engaging
- Working examples throughout
- Progressive complexity
- Games as motivation
- Accessible to beginners

### Recreating the Magic

What made 1980s learning special:
- **Discovery** - Finding things out yourself
- **Ownership** - Code you wrote, games you made
- **Community** - Sharing with others
- **Progression** - Clear path to mastery

Our curriculum aims to recreate this for modern learners.

## Personal Note

> "The Hangman game from Usborne's Computer Battlegames was my earliest introduction to programming, and why all of this exists."

This curriculum exists because someone typed in a Hangman game from a colourful book and wondered: "How does this work? What else can I make?"

That moment of curiosity - sparked by accessible, engaging educational material - is what we're trying to recreate.

**Every entry in the Vault, every game in the curriculum, every unit we write traces back to moments like that.**
