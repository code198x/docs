## Why Locomotive BASIC?

Locomotive BASIC is a capable and well-designed dialect:

- Structured features (WHILE/WEND, DEF FN)
- Good string handling
- Built-in graphics commands
- Sound commands with envelope support
- Faster than many contemporaries

## Language Features

| Feature | Locomotive BASIC | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| Loops | `FOR/NEXT`, `WHILE/WEND` | Structured option |
| Functions | `DEF FN` | User-defined functions |
| Graphics | `DRAW`, `PLOT`, `MOVE` | Similar to BBC |
| Sound | `SOUND`, `ENV`, `ENT` | Envelope support |
| Windows | `WINDOW` | Text windowing |
| Modes | `MODE 0/1/2` | Screen mode switching |

## Curriculum Approach (Proposed)

**Track:** BASIC Gateway
**Games:** 4-8 (Tier 2-3 platform)
**Units per game:** 4-12

Would teach structured BASIC with CPC-specific features:
1. Variables and basic I/O
2. Graphics modes and colours
3. Sound and envelopes
4. Animation techniques
5. File handling
6. Full game development

## Enhancement Track

| Variant | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| CPC Plus | Enhanced graphics capabilities |

## Toolchain

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| WinAPE | Emulator with BASIC environment |
