# MSX-BASIC Curriculum

**Status:** Future — Stub Entry
**Priority:** Medium
**Language:** MSX-BASIC

## Why MSX-BASIC?

MSX-BASIC is standardised across all MSX machines:

- Consistent implementation from multiple manufacturers
- Built-in sprite commands
- Music and sound support (PLAY command)
- Graphics modes via SCREEN command
- Disk BASIC extensions available

## Language Features

| Feature | MSX-BASIC | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Sprites | `SPRITE$`, `PUT SPRITE` | Hardware sprite access |
| Sound | `PLAY`, `SOUND` | MML music strings |
| Graphics | `SCREEN`, `DRAW`, `PAINT` | Multiple modes |
| Input | `STICK`, `STRIG` | Joystick support |
| Disk | Disk BASIC | File operations |

## Curriculum Approach (Proposed)

**Track:** BASIC Gateway
**Games:** 4-8 (Tier 3 platform — smaller Western audience)
**Units per game:** 4-12

Would teach MSX-specific features:
1. Screen modes and colours
2. Sprite programming
3. Sound and MML music
4. Joystick input
5. Animation techniques
6. Full game development

## Enhancement Track

| Variant | Focus |
|---------|-------|
| MSX2 | V9938 graphics, more colours |
| MSX2+ | Enhanced graphics |

## Standardisation Advantage

Unlike other 8-bit platforms, MSX code runs on:
- Sony, Philips, Panasonic, Toshiba, Canon, etc.
- Any MSX-compatible machine
- Modern FPGA recreations

## Toolchain

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| openMSX | Accurate emulator |
| blueMSX | Alternative emulator |
| MSX-BASIC | Built into MSX ROM |
