**Status:** Future — Stub Entry
**Priority:** Medium
**Languages:** STOS, GFA BASIC

## Why Atari ST BASIC?

The Atari ST has two compelling BASIC options:

### STOS (Game-Focused)
- Designed specifically for game creation
- Sprite handling built-in
- Sound and music commands
- Screen manipulation
- Extension system for additional features

### GFA BASIC (Structured)
- Fully structured BASIC (no line numbers)
- Procedures with parameters
- Local variables
- Fast compiled code
- Professional-quality applications possible

## Language Comparison

| Feature | STOS | GFA BASIC |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Focus | Games | General purpose |
| Sprites | Built-in | Via system calls |
| Structure | Traditional + extensions | Fully structured |
| Speed | Good | Excellent (compiled) |
| Learning curve | Lower | Higher |

## Curriculum Approach (Proposed)

### STOS Track
**Games:** 8 (game-focused)
**Units per game:** 4-12

Focus on game-specific features:
- Sprite creation and movement
- Screen banks
- Sound effects
- Collision detection
- STOS extensions (Maestro, etc.)

### GFA BASIC Track (Alternative)
**Games:** 4-8 (general purpose)
**Units per game:** 4-12

Focus on structured programming:
- Procedures and functions
- GEM programming
- Data structures
- Compiled applications

## Toolchain

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Hatari | Emulator |
| STOS | STOS environment |
| GFA BASIC | GFA environment |
| Steem | Alternative emulator |
