## Why Handhelds Matter

Handheld gaming taught different lessons:
- **Extreme constraints** - Tiny screens, limited buttons, battery life
- **Pick-up-and-play** - Sessions measured in minutes
- **Design innovation** - Making great games with almost nothing
- **Massive market** - Game Boy outsold everything

The constraints forced creativity that influenced all game design.
