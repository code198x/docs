## Selection Criteria

When prioritising platforms:

1. **Skill transfer** — Does it build on existing curriculum CPU knowledge?
2. **Historical significance** — Was it commercially important?
3. **Active community** — Are people still developing for it?
4. **Educational value** — Does it teach unique concepts?
5. **Tooling availability** — Are assemblers/emulators mature?
6. **Differentiation** — Does it offer something current platforms don't?
