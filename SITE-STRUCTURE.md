# Code Like It's 198x: Site Structure & Philosophy

**Core Principle:** Pattern Libraries and The Vault are equal, central destinations. They serve different purposes but link everything together.

---

## Two Primary Destinations

### 1. Pattern Libraries: "I want to learn how to code retro games"
- **Practical, hands-on learning**
- Collect reusable code patterns
- Build real games
- Transfer knowledge across platforms
- Measurable progress (patterns collected)

### 2. The Vault: "I want to understand the era"
- **Historical, encyclopaedic knowledge**
- Research, discover, explore
- Understand context, culture, people, politics
- Complete archive of retro computing era
- Someone could spend years here without writing code - and that's valid!

**They interconnect deeply:**
- Learning a pattern? See its history, who invented it, what games used it
- Reading about a game? See what patterns it pioneered
- Studying a person? See their techniques, their games, their impact
- Understanding the Cold War? See how it shaped different computing cultures

## The Vault: Complete Encyclopaedia

## Pattern Libraries: Practical Coding

### What They Are

As students progress, they **build a personal library of reusable code patterns** that solve common game programming problems.

### Structure

**Per platform, patterns organized by category:**
- Input (joystick, keyboard, collision detection)
- Graphics (sprites, scrolling, tiles, rasters)
- Sound (music, SFX, synthesis)
- Math (physics, collision, vectors)
- Data (compression, serialization, level data)
- System (interrupts, memory management, timing)

**Each pattern includes:**
1. **What it does:** Clear definition
2. **When to use it:** Use cases, alternatives
3. **Platform implementations:** C64, NES, Genesis, etc.
4. **Prerequisites:** What to learn first
5. **Builds to:** What this unlocks
6. **From The Vault:** Historical context from encyclopaedia
   - Who invented it
   - What games first used it
   - How it evolved
   - Cultural significance

### Total Count

**~12,847 patterns across 72 platforms**

- Input: ~847 patterns
- Graphics: ~3,201 patterns
- Sound: ~1,456 patterns
- Math: ~1,923 patterns
- Data: ~891 patterns
- System: ~2,134 patterns

### Learning Paths

Curated sequences of patterns for specific goals:

**"First Platformer Game"** (12 patterns)
- Sprite movement, collision, physics, scrolling, enemies, etc.

**"Shoot-em-up Essentials"** (15 patterns)
- Bullets, enemy waves, power-ups, parallax scrolling

**"RPG Foundations"** (28 patterns)

## Student Journeys: Two Types

### Journey 1: The Coder
1. **Starts:** "I want to make C64 games"
2. **Primary destination:** Pattern Library
3. **Learning path:** "First Platformer Game"
4. **Collects patterns:** Sprite movement, collision, scrolling
5. **Discovers The Vault:** "Wait, Impossible Mission used this pattern!"
6. **Explores game entry:** Sees other techniques used
7. **Builds game:** Applies collected patterns
8. **Explores more:** Transfers patterns to NES
9. **Deep dive:** Reads about programmers who inspired them
10. **Full circle:** Understanding code AND culture

### Journey 2: The Historian
1. **Starts:** "I want to understand the 1980s computer era"
2. **Primary destination:** The Vault
3. **Explores:** Commodore company history
4. **Discovers:** Jack Tramiel's business philosophy shaped C64
5. **Reads:** UK bedroom coding culture vs US corporate dev
6. **Understands:** Cold War impact on Eastern Bloc computing
7. **Explores games:** Sees what was possible on limited hardware
8. **Gets curious:** "How did they DO that?" → Pattern Library
9. **Tries coding:** Understands deeply by doing
10. **Full circle:** Understanding culture AND code

**Both journeys are valid. Both lead to complete understanding.**

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

**Patterns:**
```
patterns:
  id, title, category, difficulty, fundamental
  description, use_cases, prerequisites, builds_to
  platforms: [{ platform_id, lesson_id }]
  vault_links: [vault_entry_ids]
```

**Vault Entries:**
```
vault_entries:
  id, type (person|company|game|event|culture|politics|technique)
  title, content (rich markdown)
  dates, locations, significance

  # Cross-references
  related_people: [person_ids]
  related_companies: [company_ids]
  related_games: [game_ids]
  related_events: [event_ids]
  related_patterns: [pattern_ids]

  # Media
  images, audio, video, documents
```

**Students:**
```
students:
  id
  patterns_collected: [{ pattern_id, platform_id, date }]
  vault_explored: [{ entry_id, date, time_spent }]
  learning_paths: [path_ids]
  projects: [{ title, patterns_used, description }]
```

## Summary

**Two equal destinations:**
- **Pattern Libraries:** Learn to code retro games (practical)
- **The Vault:** Understand the era (historical/cultural)

**Deep interconnection:**
- Every pattern links to historical context
- Every historical entry links to relevant patterns
- Complete picture: code + culture

**"Code Like It's 198x" means:**
- Understanding the technical constraints
- Understanding the cultural context
- Understanding the political/economic forces
- Understanding the people who shaped it
- Being able to CREATE within those constraints
- Being able to EXPLAIN why it matters

**You can spend years here doing either or both. That's the vision.**
